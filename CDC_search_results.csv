"Illicit Drug Use, Illicit Drug Use Disorders, and Drug Overdose Deaths in Metropolitan and Nonmetropolitan Areas — United States",https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/ss/ss6619a1.htm," October 20, 2017 ","['https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/prescribing/resources.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/fatal.html']"," Problem/Condition: Drug overdoses are a leading cause of injury death in the United States, resulting in approximately 52,000 deaths in 2015. Understanding differences in illicit drug use, illicit drug use disorders, and overall drug overdose deaths in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas is important for informing public health programs, interventions, and policies.Reporting Period: Illicit drug use and drug use disorders during 2003–2014, and drug overdose deaths during 1999–2015.Description of Data: The National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) collects information through face-to-face household interviews about the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among the U.S. noninstitutionalized civilian population aged ≥12 years. Respondents include residents of households and noninstitutional group quarters (e.g., shelters, rooming houses, dormitories, migratory workers’ camps, and halfway houses) and civilians living on military bases. NSDUH variables include sex, age, race/ethnicity, residence (metropolitan/nonmetropolitan), annual household income, self-reported drug use, and drug use disorders.National Vital Statistics System Mortality (NVSS-M) data for U.S. residents include information from death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Cases were selected with an underlying cause of death based on the ICD-10 codes for drug overdoses (X40–X44, X60–X64, X85, and Y10–Y14). NVSS-M variables include decedent characteristics (sex, age, and race/ethnicity) and information on intent (unintentional, suicide, homicide, or undetermined), location of death (medical facility, in a home, or other [including nursing homes, hospices, unknown, and other locations]) and county of residence (metropolitan/nonmetropolitan).Metropolitan/nonmetropolitan status is assigned independently in each data system. NSDUH uses a three-category system: Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA) of ≥1 million persons; CBSA of <1 million persons; and not a CBSA, which for simplicity were labeled large metropolitan, small metropolitan, and nonmetropolitan. Deaths from NVSS-M are categorized by the county of residence of the decedent using CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics 2013 Urban-Rural Classification Scheme, collapsed into two categories (metropolitan and nonmetropolitan).Results: Although both metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas experienced significant increases from 2003–2005 to 2012–2014 in self-reported past-month use of illicit drugs, the prevalence was highest for the large metropolitan areas compared with small metropolitan or nonmetropolitan areas throughout the study period. Notably, past-month use of illicit drugs declined over the study period for the youngest respondents (aged 12–17 years). The prevalence of past-year illicit drug use disorders among persons using illicit drugs in the past year varied by metropolitan/nonmetropolitan status and changed over time. Across both metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas, the prevalence of past-year illicit drug use disorders declined during 2003–2014.In 2015, approximately six times as many drug overdose deaths occurred in metropolitan areas than occurred in nonmetropolitan areas (metropolitan: 45,059; nonmetropolitan: 7,345). Drug overdose death rates (per 100,000 population) for metropolitan areas were higher than in nonmetropolitan areas in 1999 , however, the rates converged in 2004, and by 2015, the nonmetropolitan rate  was slightly higher than the metropolitan rate .Interpretation: Drug use and subsequent overdoses continue to be a critical and complicated public health challenge across metropolitan/nonmetropolitan areas. The decline in illicit drug use by youth and the lower prevalence of illicit drug use disorders in rural areas during 2012–2014 are encouraging signs. However, the increasing rate of drug overdose deaths in rural areas, which surpassed rates in urban areas, is cause for concern.Public Health Actions: Understanding the differences between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas in drug use, drug use disorders, and drug overdose deaths can help public health professionals to identify, monitor, and prioritize responses. Consideration of where persons live and where they die from overdose could enhance specific overdose prevention interventions, such as training on naloxone administration or rescue breathing. Educating prescribers on CDC’s guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain (Dowell D, Haegerich TM, Chou R. CDC guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain—United States, 2016. MMWR Recomm Rep 2016;66[No. RR-1]) and facilitating better access to medication-assisted treatment with methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone could benefit communities with high opioid use disorder rates.During 1999–2014, annual age-adjusted death rates for the five leading causes of death in the United States (heart disease, cancer, unintentional injury, chronic lower respiratory disease, and stroke) were higher in rural (nonmetropolitan) areas than in urban (metropolitan) areas . Many factors influence the rural-urban mortality gap, including socioeconomic differences, health-related behaviors, and access to health care services. Residents of rural areas in the United States tend to be poorer and sicker than their urban counterparts, with rural residents in the South and West experiencing some of the most adverse health outcome .In each year during 1999–2015, all-cause injury death rates were higher in nonmetropolitan areas of the United States than they were in metropolitan areas , and previous studies indicate that rates of drug overdose death and drug use varied markedly by metropolitan/nonmetropolitan status . Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of injury death in the United States, and although prescription drugs were primarily responsible for the rapid expansion of this large and growing public health crisis, illicit drugs (heroin, illicit fentanyl, cocaine, and methamphetamines) now are contributing substantially to the problem . Age-adjusted death rates for drug overdoses varied by the drug involved and the level of urbanization. For example, natural and semisynthetic opioid-related drug overdose death rates were highest and heroin-related drug overdose death rates were lowest in nonmetropolitan areas in 2015 compared with other levels of urbanicity .A growing body of literature describes various aspects of the drug overdose epidemic and population density . Risk factors within metropolitan/nonmetropolitan status are a complicated mix of type of drug used (licit versus illicit), recreational versus pharmaceutical use, the combinations of drugs used, routes of administration (e.g., injection versus oral administration), the amount of drugs prescribed, the place used (home versus community), knowledge of potential adverse outcomes, access to overdose reversal drugs, and access to emergency services and substance abuse treatment services.This report examines trends in drug use, drug use disorders, and overdose deaths in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas of the United States through analyses of 2003–2014 National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) data and 1999–2015 National Vital Statistics System Mortality (NVSS-M) data. Public health professionals and clinicians can use these findings to identify specific subgroups and rural/urban groups in need of targeted interventions.Drug use and drug use disorder data were from the 2003–2014 NSDUH, which is managed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (https://www.samhsa.gov/data/population-data-nsduhexternal icon). NSDUH collects information through face-to-face household interviews about the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among the U.S. noninstitutionalized civilian population aged ≥12 years. Respondents include residents of households and noninstitutional group quarters (e.g., shelters, rooming houses, dormitories, migratory workers’ camps, and halfway houses) and civilians living on military bases. An independent, multistage area probability sample design for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia allows for the production of state-level and urban status (county of residence) estimates.Mortality data for U.S. residents were from the 1999–2015 NVSS-M, which is based on information from all death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Deaths of nonresidents (e.g., nonresident aliens; nationals living abroad; and residents of Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and other U.S. territories) were excluded. Mortality data are provided to CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program and coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) by NCHS. Analyses were restricted to deaths with an underlying cause of death based on the ICD-10 codes for drug overdoses (X40–X44, X60–X64, X85, and Y10–Y14) .NSDUH variables included sex, age, race/ethnicity, residence (metropolitan/nonmetropolitan area), annual household income, self-reported drug use, and drug use disorders. Metropolitan/nonmetropolitan status was coded using NSDUH’s Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA) measure, which was available across the study period. This measure uses three segments of population density: CBSA with population of ≥1 million persons (large metropolitan); CBSA with population of <1 million persons (small metropolitan); and not a CBSA (nonmetropolitan) . For this report, CBSAs with populations ≥1 million persons and <1 million persons were considered metropolitan and those classed as “not a CBSA” were considered nonmetropolitan.Self-reported drug use in NSDUH included past-month use of illicit drugs (marijuana/hashish, cocaine [including crack], inhalants, hallucinogens, or heroin) or nonmedical use of prescription-type drugs (opioids, sedatives, tranquilizers, and stimulants). The presence of a past-year illicit drug use disorder was defined using criteria specified within the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which include symptoms such as withdrawal, tolerance, use in dangerous situations, trouble with the law, and interference with major obligations at work, school, or home . Respondents were asked questions about substance use disorders if they had reported use of illicit drugs in the past 12 months. The full survey instrument is available at http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NAHDAP/studies/36361external icon.NVSS-M variables included decedent characteristics (sex, age, and race/ethnicity) and information on the intent (unintentional, suicide, homicide, or undetermined) and location of death (medical facility, in a home, or other [including nursing homes, hospices, unknown, and other locations], and county of residence [metropolitan/nonmetropolitan area]). Location of death might be different from location of drug use. NVSS-M suppression rules include not reporting cell counts with <10 persons and rates are considered unreliable for <20 deaths. Deaths were categorized as metropolitan or nonmetropolitan based on the county of residence. Nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas were identified using the NCHS 2013 county-based classification scheme . The six NCHS classification levels for counties are: 1) large central metropolitan: part of a metropolitan statistical area with ≥1 million population and covers a principal city; 2) large fringe metropolitan: part of a metropolitan statistical area with ≥1 million population but does not cover a principal city; 3) medium metropolitan: part of a metropolitan statistical area with ≥250,000 but <1 million population; 4) small metropolitan: part of a metropolitan statistical area with <250,000 population; 5) micropolitan (nonmetropolitan): part of a micropolitan statistical area (has an urban cluster of ≥10,000 but <50,000 population); and 6) noncore (nonmetropolitan): not part of a metropolitan or micropolitan statistical area. For a dichotomous measure, metropolitan (urban) combines categories 1–4 and nonmetropolitan (rural) combines 5 and 6.On the basis of NSDUH data, overall prevalence of past-month illicit drug use was estimated for four 3-year periods , by CBSA designation, sex, age group, race, and annual household income. Prevalence of past-year illicit drug use disorder among persons reporting past-year illicit drug use was calculated by large metropolitan, small metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas for the four periods, overall, and by sex. Estimates were weighted based on the complex sample design and sampling weights of the NSDUH. Years were pooled to improve the precision of estimates and enable comparisons across subgroups. Logistic regression models (presence of drug use or drug use disorder) tested p-values of beta coefficients of the year variable to assess statistically significant (p <0.05) changes in trends. Percentage change was calculated by comparing the early period  with the last period . The analysis of trends in age-adjusted death rates during 1999–2015 included all ages; death rates per 100,000 persons were adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standard population by the direct method .From 2003–2005 to 2012–2014, the prevalence of past-month use of illicit drugs was highest in large metropolitan areas . All three urban status groups (large metropolitan, small metropolitan, and nonmetropolitan) experienced significant increases in the prevalence of past-month drug use overall. Prevalence was higher for males than females during all time intervals in all urban status groups. However, in the large metropolitan group, the percentage increase in prevalence from 2003–2005 to 2012–2014 was greater for females  than for males . The prevalence of illicit drug use among nonmetropolitan females remained stable during the study period.During 2012–2014, respondents aged 18–25 years had the highest prevalence of past-month use of illicit drugs for all urban levels . For respondents in this age group, the prevalence increased slightly from 2003–2005 to 2012–2014 in large metropolitan areas  while the prevalence remained stable among small metropolitan area respondents and nonmetropolitan respondents. Past-month use of illicit drugs declined over the study period for the youngest respondents (aged 12–17 years), with the largest decline among small metropolitan area youth. Past-month use of illicit drugs increased significantly among all three urban areas among persons aged 26–34 years and those aged ≥35 years.Prevalence of past-month illicit drug use increased among both non-Hispanic whites and other races for both large and small metropolitan areas . Prevalence did not change among non-Hispanic white nonmetropolitan respondents nor among nonmetropolitan respondents of other races. When past-month illicit drug use was examined by annual household income, respondents with an annual household income <$20,000 had the highest prevalence across all three geographic groups. Persons living in large metropolitan areas with a household income of <$20,000 experienced the largest increase in past-month illicit drug use during the study period , followed by nonmetropolitan residents with a household income of $20,000–$49,999 .The prevalence of past-year illicit drug use disorders among persons reporting illicit drug use in the past year varied by metropolitan/nonmetropolitan area and sex, and changed over time . All three geographic groups experienced statistically significant declines in overall prevalence of drug use disorders during the study period. For residents in large metropolitan areas, prevalence declined 12.6%. For residents in small metropolitan areas, prevalence declined 20.7% from 20.8% during 2003–2005 to 16.5% during 2012–2014. Among nonmetropolitan residents, the prevalence of past-year illicit drug use disorders decreased 12.8%, from 18.8% during 2003–2005 to 16.4% during 2012–2014. During 2012–2014, prevalence rates were similar across the three geographic groups.Males who reported illicit drug use in the past year consistently had higher prevalence of illicit drug use disorders compared with females. In general, females experienced consistently larger declines during the study period. The prevalence of illicit drug use disorders among females declined 14.9% among those living in large metropolitan areas, 19.3% among those living in small metropolitan areas, and 23.0% among nonmetropolitan residents. The prevalence of illicit drug use disorders declined significantly in metropolitan areas for males and females. The decline in prevalence of illicit drug use disorders among nonmetropolitan residents was significant overall and for males during the study period.In 2015, nearly six times as many drug overdose deaths were reported in metropolitan areas than in nonmetropolitan areas (metropolitan: 45,059; nonmetropolitan: 7,345) in the United States . The overall percentage change in the number of deaths for nonmetropolitan areas over the time period was 325% (the percentage change in the age-adjusted death rate per 100,000 was 330%; data not reported). Although age-adjusted drug overdose death rates for metropolitan areas were higher than in nonmetropolitan areas in 1999 , the rates converged in 2004 , and in 2015 the nonmetropolitan rate  was slightly higher than the metropolitan rate .The age-adjusted drug overdose death rate for females was higher in metropolitan areas during 1999–2003 and higher in nonmetropolitan areas thereafter . The difference in rates (per 100,000 population) between areas was greatest in 2015 (metropolitan: 11.5; nonmetropolitan: 14.3). The percentage change in the number of drug overdose deaths for females increased nearly 350% in nonmetropolitan areas during 1999–2015 (the percentage change in the age-adjusted death rate per 100,000 persons was 360%). The drug overdose death rate for males was higher in metropolitan areas in all years except 2010 and 2011 with the largest difference between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan rates occurring in 1999 (metropolitan: 8.8; nonmetropolitan: 4.8).During 1999–2015, age-adjusted drug overdose death rates varied by race/ethnicity and metropolitan/nonmetropolitan area. American Indians/Alaska Natives had the highest drug overdose death rates in 2015 (metropolitan: 22.1; nonmetropolitan: 19.8) and the largest percentage change increase in the number of deaths over time (nonmetropolitan: 519%) . During 1999–2001, black decedents in metropolitan areas had the highest death rates compared to other race/ethnicity categories; the rate for white decedents in metropolitan areas was highest in 2002 and 2007, and the rate was highest in remaining years for American Indians/Alaska Natives residing in metropolitan areas. Rates for white decedents (metropolitan: 21.4) were similar to American Indians/Alaska Natives in 2015. Drug overdose death rates were lowest among Asians/Pacific Islanders in all years.Nonmetropolitan unintentional age-adjusted overdose death rates changed from 2.5 in 1999 to 14.2 in 2015 . Metropolitan unintentional overdose death rates changed from 4.3 in 1999 to 13.8 in 2015. Rates of suicide overdose deaths were similar in metropolitan  and nonmetropolitan  areas in 2015.All age group categories showed increases in drug overdose deaths from 1999 to 2015 . The percentage change increase in age-specific drug overdose deaths from 1999 to 2015 was higher for nonmetropolitan areas than metropolitan areas for persons aged ≥12 years, with the largest increase in drug overdose deaths  among those aged 18–25 years. Nonmetropolitan drug overdose death rates in 2015 were higher than metropolitan rates for those aged 26–34 years.More age-adjusted drug overdose deaths occurred in a home versus in a medical facility or other location in each year for both metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas . The distribution changed over time, however, and the percentage of deaths that occurred in a home increased from 1999 to 2015 in both metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas .The increasing trends for males and females in age-adjusted drug overdose death rates varied by the six urban levels . Drug overdose death rates had a greater range by level of urban status for males in 1999 (noncore = 4.5 to large central metropolitan = 11.8) than in 2015 (noncore = 18.4 to medium metropolitan = 23.0). Converse patterns were observed for females . At the beginning of the study period, death rates were higher in metropolitan areas than in nonmetropolitan areas, but the rates converged over time.This report presents an overview of illicit drug use, illicit drug use disorders, and drug overdose deaths for metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas in the United States. The findings of this study indicate that trends varied. On the one hand, the decline in illicit drug use by youth and the lower prevalence of illicit drug use disorders are encouraging signs. On the other hand, the increasing rate of drug overdose deaths in rural areas, which surpassed rates in urban areas, is cause for concern. Regardless of metropolitan/nonmetropolitan area, illicit drug use among youth generally declined over a 10-year period, but increased substantially in other age groups (aged 26–34 and ≥35 years). Declines in prescription opioid use disorders have also been demonstrated among persons aged 12–17 years . The percentage change increase between 1999 and 2015 in overdose deaths among nonmetropolitan residents is concerning and carries across sex, race, and intent. The type of drug involved in overdose deaths varies by metropolitan/nonmetropolitan area with rates of heroin and cocaine related overdose deaths being higher in more urban areas ; however, monitoring trends in use and drugs involved in overdoses is critical as they have changed rapidly in recent years . Although past-month use of illicit drugs was lower in nonmetropolitan areas compared to metropolitan areas, the prevalence of drug use disorders among people reporting past-year illicit drug use in nonmetropolitan areas was similar to that in metropolitan areas. Studies have found that persons with substance use disorders are at higher risk for drug use-related morbidity and mortality . Further, given research indicating that nonmetropolitan areas have less access to substance abuse treatment services  and other risk reduction strategies , the similar prevalence of drug use disorders in this study underscores the importance of scaling up these critical interventions in nonmetropolitan areas.Because of the involvement of prescription opioids in the current epidemic , monitoring prescribing levels along with understanding the local illicit drug trade is important for prevention efforts. Recent studies suggest that a leveling off and decline has occurred in opioid prescribing rates since 2012 and in high-dose prescribing rates since 2009 . However, overall opioid prescribing remained high in 2015 and the amounts prescribed varied by level of urbanization . Reducing the number of persons initially exposed to prescription opioids might reduce the illicit use of opioids, the subsequent risk of addiction, and the use of illicit drugs .Interventions for drug overdoses, such as naloxone administration, rescue breathing, or calling 911, are most useful when someone is present to administer them. In both metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas, the majority of overdose deaths occurred in a home, and rescue care could fall to friends or relatives who might lack knowledge about naloxone administration and follow-up care. In private locations, such as homes, bystanders might not know to call for emergency services after giving naloxone . Further, naloxone is less often administered by emergency medical technicians-basics (persons trained to provide basic-level life support), who are more common in rural areas  than paramedics (who can provide advanced life support care). Legislation designed to improve access to naloxone by laypersons is now present in all 50 states and the District of Columbia .Although prevalence rates of drug use in rural areas are lower in this report, the consequences of use appear to be higher. For example, an investigation of HIV infections linked to the injection of prescription opioids found that the majority of the counties at high risk for rapid dissemination of hepatitis C virus or HIV were in rural areas . Access to substance abuse treatment services is more limited in rural areas  and strengthening the health care delivery system while improving the integration of primary, specialty, and substance abuse services can provide the nexus of care needed to reduce drug misuse . Specific interventions to address overdose deaths in rural areas have been discussed previously  and might include actions such as expanding the types of emergency medical service providers that can administer naloxone to reverse a drug overdose. In addition, the following resources can assist providers and communities in efforts to reduce misuse and overdose:CDC’s rural health website (https://www.cdc.gov/ruralhealth/) and the Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain resource page (https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/prescribing/resources.html;the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration’s Opioid Overdose Toolkit (https://store.samhsa.gov/shin/content//SMA14-4742/Overdose_Toolkit.pdfpdf iconexternal icon) or the Bureau of Justice Assistance Law Enforcement Naloxone Toolkit website (https://www.bjatraining.org/tools/naloxone/Naloxone-Backgroundexternal icon);the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services resource of tools and information for families, health care providers, law enforcement, and other stakeholders about prescription drug abuse and heroin use prevention, treatment, and response (https://www.hhs.gov/opioidsexternal icon); andthe Rural Health Information Hub’s toolkit, which provides evidence-based examples, promising models, program best practices, and resources that can be used to implement substance abuse prevention and treatment programs (https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/community-health/substance-abuseexternal icon).The findings in this report are subject to at least six limitations. First, NSDUH is a self-reported survey and is subject to recall bias and social desirability; however, good validity and reliability have been found for substance use measured by NSDUH . Second, NSDUH excluded persons who were homeless and not living in shelters or persons residing in institutions, which could lead to underestimates in drug use and drug use disorders. Some areas might change in their urbanization categorization over time; however, few would have changed from the larger grouping of metropolitan to nonmetropolitan . In addition, the 2013 NCHS county-based classification scheme was used for the entire time period for parsimony. Although metropolitan/nonmetropolitan areas were not directly comparable between the two data systems, results demonstrate that it is important to consider the rural to urban continuum of population density for drug use and overdose. Third, overdose deaths are likely underestimated because lengthy investigations are often required including toxicology assessments and this sometimes results in a death being categorized as “pending manner and cause of death” at the time mortality files are closed and shared with NCHS. It was not possible to analyze this underestimation by urban level directly. Fourth, because of the misclassification of race/ethnicity of decedents on death certificates, the actual numbers of deaths for certain racial/ethnic populations (e.g., American Indians/Alaska Natives and Hispanics) might be underestimated by up to 35% . Fifth, because information on intent might be coded in the mortality file even though the case could still be under investigation, it might be difficult to determine whether a death should be certified as suicide or unintentional . Finally, the time periods were different between the two data systems (NVSS-M: 1999–2015; NSDUH: 2003–2014), so the duration of change over time varied.Drug use and subsequent overdoses continue to be a critical and complicated public health challenge. Variations and trends in drug overdose death rates by urban status differed by sex and race/ethnicity and trends among these subgroups indicate that certain groups are more profoundly affected by the epidemic than others. The decline in illicit drug use by youth and the lower prevalence of illicit drug use disorders in rural areas during 2012–2014 are encouraging signs. However, the rising death rate of drug overdoses in rural areas, which surpassed rates in urban areas, along with persistent limited access to substance abuse treatment services in rural areas is cause for concern. Educating opioid prescribers on the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain  and better access to evidence-based substance abuse treatment, including medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction, are critical steps that can be taken in communities heavily impacted by substance abuse.Corresponding author: Karin Mack, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, CDC.

"Hepatitis A Virus Outbreaks Associated with Drug Use and Homelessness — California, Kentucky, Michigan, and Utah, 2017",https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6743a3.htm," November 2, 2018 ",['https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/outbreaks/2017March-HepatitisA.htm'],"What is already known about this topic?Hepatitis A is a vaccine-preventable viral infection of the liver that is commonly transmitted through consumption of microscopic amounts of feces. Outbreaks of hepatitis A infections are infrequent in the United States and are typically associated with contaminated food items.What is added by this report?During 2017, California, Kentucky, Michigan, and Utah reported 1,521 hepatitis A infections, mostly among persons who reported drug use or homelessness, signaling a shift in hepatitis A epidemiology from point-source outbreaks associated with contaminated food to large community outbreaks with person-to-person transmission.What are the implications for public health practice?Increasing vaccination among groups at risk for hepatitis A infection might halt ongoing outbreaks and prevent future outbreaks.During 2017, CDC received 1,521 reports of acute hepatitis A virus (HAV) infections from California, Kentucky, Michigan, and Utah; the majority of infections were among persons reporting injection or noninjection drug use or homelessness. Investigations conducted by local and state health departments indicated that direct person-to-person transmission of HAV infections was occurring, differing from other recent, large HAV outbreaks attributed to consumption of contaminated commercial food products. Outbreaks with direct HAV transmission among persons reporting drug use or homelessness signals a shift in HAV infection epidemiology in the United States, and vaccination of these populations at high risk can prevent future outbreaks.Outbreak cases were defined as those meeting the 2012 CDC-Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists’ (CSTE) definition of acute hepatitis A infection,* having a specimen matching an outbreak strain, or an epidemiologic link to a previously identified case. Local and state health department personnel reviewed clinical charts and interviewed patients using standard questionnaires that evaluated risk factors associated with infection, including recent drug use, sexual history, housing status, recent international travel, and contact with another person with HAV infection.Among states reporting increases in HAV infections to CDC outside or inside the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System, only California, Kentucky, Michigan, and Utah reported sustained within-state transmission. This report includes outbreaks that occurred during 2017 in these four states. Additional cases reported from other states were excluded because they were attributed to HAV exposure during travel to one of the four outbreak states, and because prolonged, ongoing transmission did not occur in the other states.During 2017, a total of 1,521 outbreak-associated HAV cases were reported from California, Kentucky, Michigan, and Utah, with 1,073  hospitalizations and 41  deaths . Among patients for whom clinical or laboratory records were available for review, 42  had confirmed or probable hepatitis B virus coinfection, and 341  had confirmed or probable hepatitis C virus coinfection. Overall, 866  patients reported drug use, homelessness, or both . Among all cases, 818  had an indication for hepatitis A vaccination before becoming infected (i.e., using drugs or being men who had sex with men [MSM]) as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) .When available, serum specimens from patients who met the CSTE case definition were sent to CDC’s Division of Viral Hepatitis laboratory for HAV RNA isolation, genotyping, and genetic characterization. HAV RNA was extracted from immunoglobulin M antibody-positive serum samples and used to amplify and Sanger-sequence a 315–base-pair fragment of the VP1/P2B region . During 2017, 1,169 specimens from outbreak-associated cases from the four affected states were sent to CDC for additional testing. A total of 1,054  specimens had HAV confirmed by polymerase chain reaction, 1,014  of which tested positive for a genotype 1b viral strain. The strains circulating in California, Kentucky, and Utah were genetically different from those circulating in Michigan.CDC worked with affected local and state health departments to apply control measures through health advisories, public education, and vaccination clinics that provided outreach and vaccination to the targeted populations. Vaccine was administered in jails, emergency departments, syringe exchange programs, drug treatment facilities, and homeless shelters. In certain jurisdictions, investigation teams also visited homeless encampments to educate and vaccinate unsheltered homeless groups. Although reporting of new outbreak cases in California has ended, new case investigations continue in Kentucky, Michigan, and Utah. Vaccination campaigns also continue for MSM and persons who use drugs or report homelessness in the affected states.After the introduction of hepatitis A vaccine in 1996, the incidence of reported HAV infection steadily decreased in the United States until 2011 and then stabilized at an annual average of approximately 1,600 reported cases, mostly among international travelers returning from countries with endemic HAV or as part of foodborne outbreaks . HAV outbreaks among illicit drug users were common in the prevaccine era; during the mid-1980s, drug users accounted for >20% of all HAV cases reported to CDC . However, large community outbreaks within this population rarely occurred after 1996, when hepatitis A vaccine was first recommended for persons who use illicit drugs .Person-to-person transmission of HAV between those who report drug use or homelessness can result from unsafe sanitary conditions or specific sexual contact or practices, or it can be parenterally transmitted through contaminated needles or other injection paraphernalia . Transient housing, economic instability, limited access to health care, and distrust of government services make outbreaks among affected populations more difficult to control, requiring tailored comprehensive public health interventions that address their specific circumstances and needs .During 2016, U.S. hospitalization and mortality rates associated with HAV infections were 42% and 0.7%, respectively . Increased hospitalization and mortality rates observed in the 2017 HAV outbreaks might be attributable to preexisting illnesses, including chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C infections, other comorbidities, age, and risk behaviors common among persons reporting drug use and homelessness (e.g., heavy alcohol use) .Increasingly, investigations of HAV infections are using molecular epidemiology to confirm outbreaks . Laboratory data, when combined with reliable epidemiologic data, can be effective in understanding transmission networks, particularly among populations distrustful of investigators. The majority of surveillance specimens tested by CDC’s laboratory before 2017 were genotype 1a, the most common genotype in North and South America, but expansion of genotype 1b attributed to the current outbreaks is leading to increased detection of this previously uncommon genotype .Vaccination rates among existing ACIP-identified risk groups are unknown but are believed to be low . On October 24, 2018, ACIP voted unanimously to add “homelessness” as an indication for ACIP-recommended HAV vaccination .† Although the outbreak has ended in California, hepatitis A outbreaks among persons reporting drug use or homelessness continue in Kentucky, Michigan, and Utah, and, as of October 12, 2018, >7,000 outbreak associated cases have been reported from 12 states.§Increasing vaccination coverage among all at-risk groups recommended by ACIP to receive hepatitis A vaccine might halt ongoing outbreaks and prevent future large community outbreaks .CDC has recommended that local health jurisdictions experiencing HAV outbreaks among persons who report drug use or homelessness ensure procedures are in place for identifying these risk factors and that these groups are vaccinated against HAV infection.¶ State and local health departments and CDC should be notified of any new suspected clusters of acute HAV infections.Jennifer Zipprich, PhD, California Department of Public Health; Kathleen Harriman, PhD, California Department of Public Health; Utah’s local health departments; California’s local health departments; medical and mental health partners; corrections partners; syringe service providers.Corresponding author: Monique A.

During 2015–2016, age-adjusted cocaine-involved and psychostimulant-involved death rates increased by 52.4% and 33.3%, respectively.What is added by this report?From 2016 to 2017, death rates involving cocaine and psychostimulants increased across age groups, racial/ethnic groups, county urbanization levels, and multiple states. Death rates involving cocaine and psychostimulants, with and without opioids, have increased. Synthetic opioids appear to be the primary driver of cocaine-involved death rate increases, and recent data point to increasing synthetic opioid involvement in psychostimulant-involved deaths.What are the implications for public health practice?Continued increases in stimulant-involved deaths require expanded surveillance and comprehensive, evidence-based public health and public safety interventions.In 2016, a total of 63,632 persons died from drug overdoses in the United States . Drug overdose deaths involving cocaine, psychostimulants with abuse potential (psychostimulants), or both substances combined increased 42.4% from 12,122 in 2015 to 17,258 in 2016.* Psychostimulants with abuse potential include drugs such as methamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA), dextroamphetamine, levoamphetamine, methylphenidate (Ritalin), and caffeine. From 2015 to 2016, cocaine-involved and psychostimulant-involved death rates increased 52.4% and 33.3%, respectively . A total of 70,237 persons died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2017; approximately two thirds of these deaths involved an opioid . CDC analyzed 2016–2017 changes in age-adjusted death rates involving cocaine and psychostimulants by demographic characteristics, urbanization levels, U.S. Census region, 34 states, and the District of Columbia (DC). CDC also examined trends in age-adjusted cocaine-involved and psychostimulant-involved death rates from 2003 to 2017 overall, as well as with and without co-involvement of opioids. Among all 2017 drug overdose deaths, 13,942  involved cocaine, and 10,333  involved psychostimulants. Death rates increased from 2016 to 2017 for both drug categories across demographic characteristics, urbanization levels, Census regions, and states. In 2017, opioids were involved in 72.7% and 50.4% of cocaine-involved and psychostimulant-involved overdoses, respectively, and the data suggest that increases in cocaine-involved overdose deaths from 2012 to 2017 were driven primarily by synthetic opioids. Conversely, increases in psychostimulant-involved deaths from 2010 to 2017 occurred largely independent of opioids, with increased co-involvement of synthetic opioids in recent years. Provisional data from 2018 indicate that deaths involving cocaine and psychostimulants are continuing to increase.† Increases in stimulant-involved deaths are part of a growing polysubstance landscape. Increased surveillance and evidence-based multisectoral prevention and response strategies are needed to address deaths involving cocaine and psychostimulants and opioids. Enhancing linkage to care, building state and local capacity, and public health/public safety collaborations are critical components of prevention efforts.Drug overdose deaths were identified in the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files,§ using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) underlying cause-of-death codes X40–X44 (unintentional), X60–X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10–Y14 (undetermined intent). Among deaths with drug overdose as the underlying cause, the type of drug is indicated by the following ICD-10 multiple cause-of-death codes: cocaine (T40.5); psychostimulants with abuse potential (T43.6); opioids (T40.0–T40.4, and T40.6)¶; and synthetic opioids other than methadone (T40.4). Some deaths involved more than one type of drug; these deaths were included in the rates for each drug category. Thus, categories were not mutually exclusive.**Age-adjusted death rates†† were examined for the period 2016– 2017 for cocaine and psychostimulants. Death rates were stratified by age group, sex, race/ethnicity, urbanization level,§§ U.S. Census region,¶¶ and state. State-level analyses were conducted for 34 states and DC, all of which had adequate drug-specificity data recorded on death certificates for 2016 and 2017.*** Analyses comparing changes in death rates from 2016 to 2017 used z-tests when deaths were ≥100 and nonoverlapping confidence intervals based on a gamma distribution when deaths were <100.††† Trends in age-adjusted cocaine-involved and psychostimulant-involved death rates from 2003 to 2017 were analyzed overall, and with and without any opioids and synthetic opioids, using Joinpoint regression.§§§ Changes presented represent statistically significant findings unless otherwise specified.In 2017, among 70,237 drug overdose deaths that occurred in the United States, 13,942  involved cocaine, representing a 34.4% increase from 2016 (Table). Nearly three fourths  of cocaine-involved deaths in 2017 also involved opioids. Cocaine-involved death rates increased among both sexes and among persons aged ≥15 years, non-Hispanic whites (whites), non-Hispanic blacks (blacks), and Hispanics. The largest relative rate change occurred among females aged 15–24 years , and the largest absolute rate change was among males aged 25–44 and 45–64 years (increase of 2.7 per 100,000). Among racial/ethnic groups, the highest rate of cocaine-involved deaths in 2017 occurred in blacks , who also experienced the largest relative rate change  compared with 2016. By urban-rural status, counties in medium metro areas experienced the largest absolute rate increase  in 2017, whereas the largest relative rate increase occurred in micropolitan counties . The Midwest Census region had the largest relative rate increase , whereas the highest 2017 rate was in the Northeast . Death rates involving cocaine increased in 15 states, with the largest relative increases in Wisconsin  and Maryland , and the largest absolute rate increases in Ohio  and Maryland . In 2017, the highest death rates were in DC  and Ohio .During 2003–2017, rates for all cocaine-involved deaths peaked initially in 2006, decreased during 2006–2012, and increased again during 2012–2017. Rates of overdose deaths involving cocaine and any opioid increased from 2013 to 2017, and those involving cocaine and synthetic opioids increased from 2012 to 2017 . Cocaine-involved death rates without any opioid decreased from 2006 to 2012 and then increased from 2012 to 2017, whereas cocaine-involved death rates without synthetic opioids increased from 2003 to 2006, decreased from 2006 to 2010, and then increased from 2010 to 2017 .In 2017, a total of 10,333 deaths involving psychostimulants occurred, representing 14.7% of drug overdose deaths and a 37.0% increase from 2016 (Table). During 2016–2017, the age-adjusted rate for psychostimulant-involved deaths increased by 33.3%. Approximately half  of psychostimulant-involved deaths also involved opioids in 2017. Psychostimulant-involved death rates increased among both sexes and among persons aged ≥15 years, whites, blacks, non-Hispanic American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/AN), non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islanders (A/PI), and Hispanics. The largest relative rate increase occurred among females aged 25–44 years . Among racial/ethnic groups, the largest relative rate increase occurred among whites , whereas AI/AN experienced the largest absolute rate increase  and the highest death rate  in 2017. Counties in medium metro areas experienced the largest absolute rate increase , and the largest relative rate increase . Among Census regions, both the largest relative increase  and the largest absolute rate increase  occurred in the Midwest, whereas the highest psychostimulant-involved death rate  occurred in the West. Death rates increased in 17 states, with the largest relative increases in Ohio  and West Virginia , and the largest absolute rate increases in West Virginia  and Kentucky . In 2017, the highest death rates were in West Virginia  and Alaska .During 2003–2017, rates for all psychostimulant-involved deaths increased from 2010 to 2017. Death rates involving psychostimulants and any opioid increased from 2003 to 2010, followed by sharper increases from 2010 to 2015 and from 2015 to 2017. Death rates involving psychostimulants and synthetic opioids increased from 2010 to 2015, followed by a sharper increase from 2015 to 2017 . Rates of psychostimulant-involved deaths without any opioid involvement increased from 2008 to 2017, and rates without synthetic opioid involvement increased from 2008 to 2017 .Deaths involving cocaine and psychostimulants have increased in the United States in recent years; among 70,237 drug overdose deaths in 2017, nearly a third  involved cocaine, psychostimulants, or both. From 2016 to 2017, death rates involving cocaine and psychostimulants each increased by approximately one third, and increases occurred across all demographic groups, Census regions, and in several states. In 2017, nearly three fourths of cocaine-involved and roughly one half of psychostimulant-involved overdose deaths, respectively, involved at least one opioid. After initially peaking in 2006, trends in overall cocaine-involved death rates declined through 2012, when they began to rise again. The 2006–2012 decrease paralleled a decline in cocaine supply coupled with an increase in cost.¶¶¶ Similar patterns in death rates involving both cocaine and opioids were observed, with increases for cocaine- and synthetic opioid-involved deaths occurring from 2012 to 2017. From 2010 to 2017, increasing rates of deaths involving psychostimulants occurred and persisted even in the absence of opioids. Drug overdoses continue to evolve along with emerging threats, changes in the drug supply, mixing of substances with or without the user’s knowledge, and polysubstance use . In addition, the availability of psychostimulants, particularly methamphetamine, appears to be increasing across most regions.**** In 2017, among drug products obtained by law enforcement that were submitted for laboratory testing, methamphetamine and cocaine were the most and third most frequently identified drugs, respectively.†††† Previous studies also found that heroin and synthetic opioids (e.g., illicitly-manufactured fentanyl) have contributed to increases in stimulant-involved deaths . Current findings further support that increases in stimulant-involved deaths are part of a growing polysubstance landscape. Although synthetic opioids appear to be driving much of the increase in cocaine-involved deaths, increases in psychostimulant-involved deaths have occurred largely without opioid co-involvement; however, recent data suggest increasing synthetic opioid involvement in these deaths.The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, at autopsy, substances tested for and circumstances under which tests are performed vary by time and jurisdiction. Therefore, recent improvements in toxicologic testing might account for some reported increases. Second, 15% and 12% of death certificates in 2016 and 2017, respectively, did not include mention of specific drugs involved. The percentage of death certificates with at least one drug specified varied widely by state, ranging from 54.7% to 99.3% in 2017, limiting comparisons across states. Third, potential racial misclassification might lead to underestimates for certain groups, primarily AI/AN and A/PI.§§§§ Finally, certain trend analyses were limited, given small numbers of deaths and the inability to calculate stable rates among some stimulant-opioid drug combinations before 2003.Preliminary 2018 data indicate continued increases in drug overdose deaths.¶¶¶¶ The rise in deaths involving cocaine and psychostimulants and the continuing evolution of the drug landscape indicate a need for a rapid, multifaceted, and broad approach that includes more timely and comprehensive surveillance efforts to inform tailored and effective prevention and response strategies. CDC currently funds 45 states and DC for opioid surveillance***** and/or prevention activities.††††† The contribution of opioids to increases in stimulant-involved overdose deaths underscores the importance of continued opioid overdose surveillance and prevention measures, including existing efforts to expand naloxone availability to persons at risk for drug overdose. CDC is expanding drug overdose surveillance efforts to include stimulants and is implementing multiple, evidence-based opioid prevention efforts, such as enhancing linkage to care, building state and local capacity, and public health/public safety collaborations.§§§§§ Because some stimulant deaths are also increasing without opioid co-involvement, prevention and response strategies need to evolve accordingly. Increased efforts are required to identify and improve access to care for persons using stimulants, implement upstream prevention efforts focusing on shared risk and protective factors that address substance use/misuse, and improve risk reduction messaging (e.g., not using alone). Continued collaborations among public health, public safety, and community partners are critical to understanding the local illicit drug supply and reducing risk as well as linking persons to medication-assisted treatment and risk-reduction services.Corresponding authors: Mbabazi Kariisa, mkariisa@cdc.gov, 404-498-1560; Lawrence Scholl, lzi8@cdc.gov, 404-498-1489.1Division of Unintentional Injury Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, CDC.All authors have completed and submitted the ICMJE form for disclosure of potential conflicts of interest.

Death rates involving psychostimulants and synthetic opioids were greater than zero only during 2010–2017. From 2010 to 2015, these rates increased annually by 44.7% (CI = 2.8–103.5), followed by a 142.8% (CI = 43.7–310.2) annual increase from 2015 to 2017. Death rates involving psychostimulants without any opioids remained stable from 2003 to 2008, then increased annually by 22.3% (CI = 20.6–24.0) from 2008 to 2017. Death rates involving psychostimulants without synthetic opioids remained stable from 2003 to 2008, then increased annually by 22.3% (CI = 20.7–23.9) from 2008 to 2017."
"Notes from the Field: Hepatitis A Outbreak Associated with Drug Use and Homelessness — West Virginia, 2018",https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6814a4.htm," April 12, 2019 ",['https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/outbreaks/2017March-HepatitisA.htm'],"In March 2018, the Kanawha-Charleston Health Department (KCHD) in West Virginia began investigating a cluster of reported hepatitis A virus (HAV) infections. Twelve specimens tested by CDC’s Division of Viral Hepatitis laboratory confirmed that patients were infected with an HAV strain (genotype 1B) reported in ongoing hepatitis A outbreaks in multiple states, primarily among persons who use drugs and persons experiencing homelessness . In August 2018, because of ongoing reporting of cases, the West Virginia Bureau of Public Health requested epidemiologic assistance from CDC in responding to the outbreak.Upon retrospective review, KCHD identified a total of 664 outbreak-associated hepatitis A cases that occurred from January 1, 2018 to August 28, 2018. Outbreak cases met the 2012 Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists’ case definition for an acute hepatitis A infection* and had either an epidemiologic link to an identified outbreak case, a laboratory specimen matching the outbreak strain, or occurred in a person at high risk for infection (e.g., reported injection or noninjection drug use, experienced homelessness or unstable housing, or was recently incarcerated) or who resided in a county where the outbreak genotype had been previously identified through laboratory testing. Median age of the patients was 37 years (range = 14–77 years); 398 of the patients  were male, 380  were hospitalized, and one  died. Current or past illicit drug use was reported by 540  patients, and being homeless or having a transient living situation was reported by 100 . Evidence of past or current hepatitis C virus infection was identified in 314  outbreak-associated cases, and 65  patients had evidence of past or current hepatitis B virus infection.HAV is typically shed in the stool of infected persons and primarily spread by the fecal-oral route, either through direct person-to-person contact or consumption of contaminated food or water. In this outbreak, transmission was primarily person-to-person among persons with a current or past history of injection or noninjection drug use.Hepatitis A is a vaccine-preventable disease; vaccination is the primary method for stopping an outbreak . Vaccination measures were undertaken at both the state and county level in an effort to control the outbreak. Statewide hepatitis A vaccination initiatives in August 2018 included vaccination at four regional jails, through harm reduction programs, and at a large comprehensive drug treatment center, as well as provision of vaccination toolkits to 40 federally qualified health centers. Vaccination campaigns by KCHD targeted populations at high risk for HAV infection and included opt-out vaccination upon entry into homeless shelters; vaccinations at meal centers, drop-in centers, and other locations where services are provided to persons experiencing homelessness; and, through local emergency medical services, vaccination of persons who used drugs or were close contacts of patients with confirmed HAV infection. Mapping of outbreak-associated cases and administration of hepatitis A vaccine to adults in KCHD’s catchment area were used to guide vaccination strategies. As of February 2019, the statewide outbreak was ongoing, with 74 new outbreak-associated cases reported during January; however, fewer than five of those were in Kanawha County.In other states experiencing similar person-to-person hepatitis A outbreaks, hepatitis A vaccination campaigns have successfully targeted populations at risk by vaccinating in emergency departments and at syringe exchange programs, jails, and drug treatment facilities . Increasing vaccination coverage among groups at high risk for HAV infection as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices  can slow ongoing outbreaks and prevent future outbreaks. Engaging partners to provide hepatitis A vaccine to persons at highest risk at all possible points of contact with the health care system and service providers might help improve vaccination coverage among groups at high risk.Corresponding author: Megan G.

"Increased Methamphetamine, Injection Drug, and Heroin Use Among Women and Heterosexual Men with Primary and Secondary Syphilis — United States, 2013–2017",https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6806a4.htm," February 15, 2019 ",['https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats17/default.htm'],"What is already known about this topic?During 2013–2017, the primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis rate increased 72.7% nationally and 155.6% among women.What is added by this report?During 2013–2017, reported methamphetamine, injection drug, and heroin use increased substantially among women and heterosexual men with P&S syphilis.What are the implications for public health practice?Heterosexual syphilis transmission and drug use, particularly methamphetamine use, are intersecting epidemics. Collaboration between sexually transmitted disease control programs and substance use disorder services providers will be essential to address recent increases in heterosexual syphilis transmission. Linking syphilis patients with substance use disorders to behavioral health services and providing syphilis screening for persons receiving substance use disorder services are needed to address these co-occurring conditions.During 2013–2017, the national annual rate of reported primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis cases in the United States increased 72.7%, from 5.5 to 9.5 cases per 100,000 population . The highest rates of P&S syphilis are seen among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (collectively referred to as MSM) , and MSM continued to account for the majority of cases in 2017 . However, during 2013–2017, the P&S syphilis rate among women increased 155.6% (from 0.9 to 2.3 cases per 100,000 women), and the rate among all men increased 65.7% (from 10.2 to 16.9 cases per 100,000 men), indicating increasing transmission between men and women in addition to increasing transmission between men . To further understand these trends, CDC analyzed national P&S syphilis surveillance data for 2013–2017 and assessed the percentage of cases among women, men who have sex with women only (MSW), and MSM who reported drug-related risk behaviors during the past 12 months. Among women and MSW with P&S syphilis, reported use of methamphetamine, injection drugs, and heroin more than doubled during 2013–2017. In 2017, 16.6% of women with P&S syphilis used methamphetamine, 10.5% used injection drugs, and 5.8% used heroin during the preceding 12 months. Similar trends were seen among MSW, but not among MSM. These findings indicate that a substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission is occurring among persons who use these drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Collaboration between sexually transmitted disease (STD) control programs and partners that provide substance use disorder services will be important to address recent increases in heterosexual syphilis.P&S syphilis case report data were extracted from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System, the system through which CDC receives syphilis and other notifiable sexually transmitted disease data from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. P&S syphilis case report data include demographic information and also risk factor information, such as information about sex partners and drug use within the past 12 months, which is obtained through case interviews or investigation by the local health department.For this analysis, men with syphilis were categorized as MSM if they reported having sex with any male partner in the last 12 months; men who reported having sex with only female partners in the last 12 months were categorized as MSW. To assess drug-related behaviors, the following are included in the case report data as separate yes/no variables: use of injection drugs, methamphetamines, heroin, cocaine, crack, nitrates/poppers, erectile dysfunction drugs, other drugs, no drugs; and sex with a person who injects drugs within the last 12 months. The percentage of persons reporting use of each drug or behavior was calculated separately, using those with a “yes” response to the relevant variable as the numerator. For the injection drug use and sex with a person who injects drugs variables, the percentage of persons reporting these behaviors was calculated among persons with “yes” or “no” responses for that behavior (i.e., those with missing or unknown responses were excluded from the denominator). Because some local health departments collected data on the remaining drug use variables (e.g., methamphetamine and heroin use) differently and did not routinely report “no” responses to these variables, persons with missing and unknown responses for these remaining drug use variables were included in the denominator if they had a “yes” response to any of these variables and also did not have a “no” response to any of these variables (i.e., for these persons, missing and unknown responses were assumed to be “no” responses). SAS statistical software (version 9.3, SAS Institute Inc.) was used for all analyses.During 2013–2017, the percentage of persons with P&S syphilis who reported methamphetamine use, sex with a person who injects drugs, injection drug use, or heroin use within the past 12 months more than doubled among women and MSW . The percentage of persons with P&S syphilis reporting methamphetamine use increased from 6.2% to 16.6% among women, and from 5.0% to 13.3% among MSW, but decreased from 9.2% to 8.0% among MSM. The percentage of persons with P&S syphilis reporting sex with a person who injects drugs increased from 5.5% to 12.4% among women and from 3.6% to 9.3% among MSW, but increased only slightly among MSM (from 4.3% to 5.2%). Injection drug use increased from 4.0% to 10.5% among women with P&S syphilis and from 2.8% to 6.3% among MSW, but remained stable at 3.5% among MSM. Heroin use increased from 2.1% to 5.8% among women with P&S syphilis and from 0.8% to 2.7% among MSW, but remained relatively stable (increased from 0.7% to 0.8%) among MSM.Among women with P&S syphilis, increases in methamphetamine use, sex with a person who injects drugs, injection drug use, and heroin use were observed in every region of the United States . Among MSW with P&S syphilis, the increase in sex with a person who injects drugs was observed in every region, and the increases in methamphetamine, injection drug, and heroin use occurred in all regions except the Northeast . Although trends were generally similar across regions, the prevalence of these behaviors among women and MSW with P&S syphilis varied considerably by region. In 2017, the percentages of both women and MSW reporting these behaviors were highest in the West and lowest in the Northeast. In the West, methamphetamine use during the past 12 months was reported by 34.8% of women with P&S syphilis and 25.0% of MSW with P&S syphilis. In addition, 22.6% of women with P&S syphilis in the West had sex with a person who injects drugs, and 21.2% used injection drugs . In contrast, <3% of women or MSW with P&S syphilis in the Northeast reported these behaviors in 2017  . Additional data on other behaviors and characteristics reported among persons with P&S syphilis, such as number of sex partners, HIV status, and other drug use data, are available online in a supplemental syphilis surveillance report (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats17/syphilis2017/).Since reaching a historic low in the United States in 2000–2001, the annual national rate of reported P&S syphilis cases has increased, and the rate in 2017  was the highest reported since 1993 . Until 2013, the increase was primarily among MSM, and rates of P&S syphilis among women remained low and relatively stable . However, during 2013–2017, the P&S syphilis rate increased among both men and women . This report demonstrates that, during this same period, the prevalences of methamphetamine use, sex with a person who injects drugs, injection drug use, and heroin use within the past 12 months more than doubled among MSW and women with P&S syphilis, but not among MSM with P&S syphilis.These findings indicate that a substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission is occurring among persons who use methamphetamine, inject drugs or have sex with persons who inject drugs, or who use heroin, and that heterosexual syphilis and drug use are intersecting epidemics. A linkage between heterosexual syphilis and drug use has been observed previously. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, increases in heterosexual syphilis were associated with crack cocaine use . Drug use, particularly use of methamphetamine and injection drugs, is associated with sexual behaviors that increase the risk for acquiring syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases, including having multiple sex partners or concurrent sexual partnerships, inconsistent condom use, and exchange of sex for drugs or money . In addition, among persons who use drugs, stigma and mistrust of the health care system along with other social determinants of health (e.g., unstable housing, poverty, incarceration, and lack of health insurance or a medical home) might contribute to decreased health care utilization and reluctance or inability to identify and locate sex partners, resulting in delays in diagnosis and treatment . These complications likely contribute to increasing syphilis incidence in communities and pose significant challenges to syphilis prevention and control efforts.Pilot projects have demonstrated the feasibility and benefit of implementing substance use disorder interventions in STD clinics . STD programs should consider partnering with substance use disorder prevention and treatment programs and other organizations that provide services to persons who use drugs in the local community. Heterosexual networks and sexual risk behaviors are linked with drug use, and STD programs should work with substance use programs to facilitate referrals to substance use disorder treatment services when needed and to integrate STD and substance use disorder prevention and treatment services when possible. Substance use disorder programs and other community organizations that provide services to persons who use drugs can also provide opportunities for STD prevention and case-finding, through promotion of safer sex practices, condom distribution, and testing for syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections.The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, syphilis case report data do not include data on opioid use other than heroin, so it was not possible to assess nonheroin opioid use among persons with syphilis. Second, cases with incomplete data on variables of interest were excluded from this analysis. Overall, depending on the year and variable, 18%–25% of reported cases of P&S syphilis among women, MSW, and MSM were missing data on methamphetamine use, sex with a person who injects drugs, injection drug use, or heroin use during 2013–2017. If persons whose records had missing data were less likely to have a risk factor, it is possible that this analysis overestimated the prevalence of these risk factors among persons with syphilis. Finally, because of stigma surrounding these risk behaviors, some persons might have been reluctant to disclose drug use, leading to misclassification and underestimates of the true percentage of persons with syphilis who used these drugs.The recent increases in heterosexual syphilis, together with the concurrent increases in percentage of persons with P&S syphilis reporting methamphetamine use, sex with a person who injects drugs, injection drug use, and heroin use, are causes for concern. Heterosexual syphilis and drug use, particularly methamphetamine use, are connected and interrelated epidemics in the United States. Collaboration between STD control programs and partners that provide services for persons with substance use disorders will be essential to address recent increases in heterosexual syphilis and link patients to clinical and prevention services.Corresponding author: Sarah E.

Food and Drug Administration Approval for Use of Hiberix as a 3-Dose Primary Haemophilus influenzae Type b (Hib) Vaccination Series,https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6516a3.htm," April 29, 2016 ",[],"On January 14, 2016, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals (Research Triangle Park, North Carolina) received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to expand use of Hiberix (Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine [Tetanus Toxoid Conjugate]) for a 3-dose infant primary vaccination series at ages 2, 4, and 6 months. Hiberix was first licensed in the United States in August 2009 for use as a booster dose in children aged 15 months through 4 years under the Accelerated Approval Regulations, in response to a Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine shortage that lasted from December 2007 to July 2009 . Expanding the age indication to include infants provides another vaccine option in addition to other currently licensed monovalent or combination Hib vaccines recommended for the primary vaccination series.* Hiberix contains 10 μg purified capsular polyribosyl ribitolphosphate (PRP) conjugated to 25 μg tetanus toxoid (PRP-T) and is supplied as a single-dose vial of lyophilized vaccine to be reconstituted with saline diluent. For the 3-dose primary series, a single  dose should be given by intramuscular injection at ages 2, 4, and 6 months; the first dose may be given as early as age 6 weeks. The recommended catch-up schedule for PRP-T vaccines (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/child-adolescent.html) should be followed. As previously recommended, a single booster dose should be administered to children aged 15 months through 18 months; to facilitate timely booster vaccination, Hiberix can be administered as early as age 12 months, in accordance with Hib vaccination schedules for routine and catch-up immunization .Immunogenicity and safety data for the use of Hiberix as a primary vaccination series in infants are from a phase three, single-blind, randomized, multicenter study conducted among 4,003 healthy infants treated at 67 sites in the United States . Noninferiority of Hiberix to ActHIB (U.S.-licensed monovalent Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine [Tetanus Toxoid Conjugate], manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur, Swiftwater, PA) was assessed 1 month after completion of the primary series (after dose 3) using anti-PRP antibody concentrations ≥0.15 μg/mL and ≥1.0 μg/mL. Based on animal and human studies, anti-PRP levels of ≥0.15 μg/mL and ≥1.0 μg/mL provide protection from invasive Hib disease in the short- and long-term, respectively.For each study group, Hiberix was coadministered with recommended routine childhood vaccines (Pediarix [diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP)/hepatitis B (HepB)/inactivated poliovirus (IPV)]; Prevnar13 [Pneumococcal 13-valent Conjugate Vaccine], and Rotarix [Rotavirus Vaccine, Live, Oral Suspension]), and noninferiority of immune responses to antigens contained in the coadministered vaccines, with the exception of Rotarix, was assessed. Adverse events with onset <31 days after each vaccination were recorded and physician-verified serious adverse events were reported from time of vaccination through 6 months after vaccination.Immunogenicity. Approximately 2,000 infants were included in the immunogenicity assessment. One month after dose 3, anti-PRP concentrations ≥0.15 μg/ml and ≥1.0 μg/ml were achieved in 96.6% and 81.2% of infants who received Hiberix, respectively, and in 96.7% and 89.8% of infants who received ActHIB, respectively. Noninferiority criteria were met for anti-PRP response ≥0.15 μg/ml, but were not met for anti-PRP response ≥1.0 g/ml. Noninferiority criteria were met for the following antigens contained in coadministered vaccines: 13 serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae; poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3; hepatitis B; pertussis toxin, filamentous hemagglutinin, and pertactin; diphtheria; and tetanus.An open label study compared Pentacel (DTaP/IPV/Hib combination vaccine) and Hiberix at 1 month after dose 3; noninferiority was not assessed as a primary objective. The percentages of infants with titers ≥0.15 μg/ml and ≥1.0 μg/ml were higher after the 3rd dose of Hiberix  than after the 3rd dose of Pentacel .Safety. Approximately 3,500 vaccinated infants were included in the safety assessment. Injection site pain, irritability, and drowsiness were the most frequently reported adverse events; rates were similar for Hiberix, ActHIB, and Pentacel. Fever >103.1°F  occurred in <1% of infants in all study groups. No deaths occurred. Nonfatal serious adverse events were reported for 3.6%, 4.6%, and 4.0% of infants receiving Hiberix, ActHIB, and Pentacel, respectively; one serious adverse event in the Hiberix group was considered related to vaccine administration (afebrile seizure 14 days after dose 1; the patient had no apparent seizure disorder at 1 month after dose 3).Further information is available in the package insert (http://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/UCM179530.pdfpdf iconexternal icon).Corresponding author: Elizabeth C.

"Drug and Opioid-Involved Overdose Deaths — United States, 2017–2018",https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6911a4.htm," March 20, 2020 ","['https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/deaths.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/urban_rural.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/urban_rural.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/urban_rural.htm']","What is already known about this topic?In 2017, 68% of the 70,237 U.S. drug overdose deaths involved an opioid. During 2016–2017, deaths involving all opioids and synthetic opioids increased; deaths involving prescription opioids and heroin remained stable.What is added by this report?Opioids were involved in approximately 70%  of drug overdose deaths during 2018, representing decreases from 2017 in overdose death rates involving all opioids , prescription opioids , and heroin ; rates involving synthetic opioids increased 10%.What are the implications for public health practice?Surveillance of overdose and polysubstance use trends and the illicit drug supply to track emerging threats, enhancing linkage to treatment, and a multisectoral response are critical to sustaining and accelerating declines in opioid-involved deaths.Of the 70,237 drug overdose deaths in the United States in 2017, approximately two thirds  involved an opioid . In recent years, increases in opioid-involved overdose deaths have been driven primarily by deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone (hereafter referred to as synthetic opioids) . CDC analyzed changes in age-adjusted death rates from 2017 to 2018 involving all opioids and opioid subcategories* by demographic characteristics, county urbanization levels, U.S. Census region, and state. During 2018, a total of 67,367 drug overdose deaths occurred in the United States, a 4.1% decline from 2017; 46,802  involved an opioid . From 2017 to 2018, deaths involving all opioids, prescription opioids, and heroin decreased 2%, 13.5%, and 4.1%, respectively. However, deaths involving synthetic opioids increased 10%, likely driven by illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF), including fentanyl analogs . Efforts related to all opioids, particularly deaths involving synthetic opioids, should be strengthened to sustain and accelerate declines in opioid-involved deaths. Comprehensive surveillance and prevention measures are critical to reducing opioid-involved deaths, including continued surveillance of evolving drug use and overdose, polysubstance use, and the changing illicit drug market; naloxone distribution and outreach to groups at risk for IMF exposure; linkage to evidence-based treatment for persons with substance use disorders; and continued partnerships with public safety.Drug overdose deaths were identified in National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files† using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) underlying cause-of-death codes X40–X44 (unintentional), X60–X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10–Y14 (undetermined intent). Among deaths with drug overdose as the underlying cause, the opioid subcategory was determined by the following ICD-10 multiple cause-of-death codes: all opioids (T40.0, T40.1, T40.2, T40.3, T40.4, or T40.6)§; prescription opioids (T40.2 or T40.3); heroin (T40.1); and synthetic opioids other than methadone (T40.4). Some deaths involved more than one opioid subcategory and were included in the rates for each; subcategories are not mutually exclusive.¶Changes from 2017 to 2018 in age-adjusted overdose death rates** were examined for all opioids, prescription opioids, heroin, and synthetic opioids. Death rates were stratified by age, sex, race/ethnicity, urbanization level,†† U.S. Census region,§§ and state. State-level analyses included 38 states and the District of Columbia (DC) with adequate drug specificity¶¶ for 2017 and 2018.*** The drug or drugs involved in the drug overdose death were not specified on 12% of drug overdose death certificates in 2017 and on 8% of those from 2018. The percentage of 2018 death certificates with at least one drug specified ranged from 54.1% to 100% among states. Changes in death rates from 2017 to 2018 were compared using z-tests when deaths were ≥100 and nonoverlapping confidence intervals based on a gamma distribution when <100.††† Changes presented in the text represent statistically significant findings, unless otherwise specified.During 2018, drug overdoses resulted in 67,367 deaths in the United States, a 4.1% decrease from 2017. Among these drug overdose deaths, 46,802  involved an opioid. From 2017 to 2018, opioid-involved death rates decreased 2.0%, from 14.9 per 100,000 population to 14.6 ; decreases occurred among females; persons aged 15–34 years and 45–54 years; non-Hispanic whites; and in small metro, micropolitan, and noncore areas; and in the Midwest and South regions. Rates during 2017–2018 increased among persons aged ≥65 years, non-Hispanic blacks, and Hispanics, and in the Northeast and the West regions. Rates decreased in 11 states and DC and increased in three states, with the largest relative (percentage) decrease in Iowa (–30.4%) and the largest absolute decrease (difference in rates) in Ohio (–9.6); the largest relative and absolute increase occurred in Missouri . The highest opioid-involved death rate in 2018 was in West Virginia .Prescription opioid-involved death rates decreased by 13.5% from 2017 to 2018. Rates decreased in males and females, persons aged 15–64 years, non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Natives, and across all urbanization levels. Prescription opioid–involved death rates remained stable in the Northeast and decreased in the Midwest, South, and the West. Seventeen states experienced declines in prescription opioid–involved death rates, with no states experiencing significant increases. The largest relative decrease occurred in Ohio (–40.5%), whereas the largest absolute decrease occurred in West Virginia (–4.1), which also had the highest prescription opioid-involved death rate in 2018 .Heroin-involved death rates decreased 4.1% from 2017 to 2018; reductions occurred among males and females, persons aged 15–34 years, non-Hispanic whites, and in large central metro and large fringe metro areas . Rates decreased in the Midwest and increased in the West. Rates decreased in seven states and DC and increased in three states from 2017 to 2018. The largest relative decrease occurred in Kentucky , and the largest absolute decrease occurred in DC (–7.1); the largest relative and absolute increase was in Tennessee . The highest heroin-involved death rate in 2018 was in Vermont .Death rates involving synthetic opioids increased from 9.0 per 100,000 population in 2017 to 9.9 in 2018 and accounted for 67.0% of opioid-involved deaths in 2018. These rates increased from 2017 to 2018 among males and females, persons aged ≥25 years, non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics, non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islanders, and in large central metro, large fringe metro, medium metro, and small metro counties. Synthetic opioid–involved death rates increased in the Northeast, South and West and remained stable in the Midwest. Rates increased in 10 states and decreased in two states. The largest relative increase occurred in Arizona , and the largest absolute increase occurred in Maryland and Missouri ; the largest relative and absolute decrease was in Ohio (–20.7%, –6.7). The highest synthetic opioid–involved death rate in 2018 occurred in West Virginia .During 1999–2018, opioids were involved in 446,032 deaths in the United States.§§§ From 2017 to 2018, relative decreases occurred in death rates involving all drug overdoses (–4.1%), all opioids (–2.0%), prescription opioids (–13.5%), and heroin (–4.1%); a relative increase occurred in the rate of overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids . Decreases in all opioid-involved death rates were largely driven by those involving prescription opioids. The number of filled opioid prescriptions peaked in 2012 and decreased thereafter . Efforts to reduce high-dose opioid prescribing¶¶¶  have increased and have contributed to decreases in prescription opioid–involved deaths. Factors that might be contributing to the decrease in heroin-involved deaths include fewer persons initiating heroin use , shifts from a heroin-based market to a fentanyl-based market , increased treatment provision for persons using heroin, and expansion of naloxone access . Increases in synthetic opioid–involved deaths are likely driven by proliferation of IMF or fentanyl analogs in the illicit drug supply . According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, fentanyl was the most identified synthetic opioid found during drug seizures in the first half of 2017 ; in addition, fentanyl reports in all regions increased during 2014–2018.**** This is consistent with current findings indicating recent increases in synthetic opioid–involved death rates in all regions except the Midwest.The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, postmortem toxicology testing varies by jurisdiction; improvements in testing might account for some reported increases. Second, the percentage of 2017 and 2018 death certificates with at least one drug specified varied among states and over time, limiting opioid subcategory rate comparisons. Third, because heroin is metabolized to morphine , some heroin deaths might have been misclassified as morphine deaths, resulting in an underreporting of heroin deaths. Fourth, potential race misclassification might have led to underestimates for certain categories, particularly American Indian/Alaska Natives and Asian/Pacific Islanders.†††† Finally, adequate drug specificity data were available from only 38 states and DC, which might limit generalizability of state-based analyses.From 2017 to 2018, small decreases occurred in all overdose deaths and in deaths involving all opioids, prescription opioids, and heroin; however, deaths involving synthetic opioids continued to increase in 2018 and accounted for two thirds of opioid-involved deaths. Findings also highlight increases in deaths among non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics, indicating the need for culturally tailored interventions that address social determinants of health and structural-level factors. In addition, changing substance use patterns, including the resurgence of methamphetamine use, particularly among persons using opioids  and the mixing of opioids with methamphetamine and cocaine in the illicit drug supply , have continued to make the drug overdose landscape more complicated and surveillance and prevention efforts more challenging. To sustain decreases and prevent continued increases, continued urgent action is needed. Overdose Data to Action§§§§ is a 3-year cooperative agreement through which CDC funds health departments in 47 states, DC, two territories, and 16 cities and counties for surveillance and prevention efforts. These measures include obtaining more timely data on all drug overdoses, improving toxicology to better identify polysubstance-involved deaths, enhancing linkage to treatment for persons with opioid use disorder and risk for opioid overdose, improving prescription drug monitoring programs, implementing health systems interventions, partnering with public safety, and implementing other innovative surveillance and prevention activities. Because of the reductions observed in deaths involving prescription opioids, continued efforts to encourage safe prescribing practices, such as following the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain  might be enhanced by increased use of nonopioid and nonpharmacologic treatments for pain. Additional public health efforts to reduce opioid-involved overdose deaths include expanding the distribution of naloxone, addressing polysubstance use, and increasing the provision of medication-assisted treatment. Enhanced and coordinated multisectoral surveillance of the illicit drug supply¶¶¶¶ to track emerging threats, including the type and amount of specific drugs, could also help prevent overdoses. A comprehensive, multisectoral surveillance, prevention, and response approach remains critical for sustaining and expanding preliminary successes in reducing opioid-involved overdose deaths and specifically curtailing synthetic opioid–involved deaths and other emerging threats.Corresponding authors: Nana Wilson, wie4@cdc.gov, 404-498-1821; Mbabazi Kariisa, mkariisa@cdc.gov, 404-498-1560.1Division of Overdose Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, CDC; 2Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, Oak Ridge, Tennessee.All authors have completed and submitted the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors form for disclosure of potential conflicts of interest.

"Increases in Drug and Opioid-Involved Overdose Deaths — United States, 2010–2015",https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm655051e1.htm," December 30, 2016 ","['https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/mortality_public_use_data.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/statedeaths.html']","What is already known about this topic?The U.S. opioid epidemic is continuing. Drug overdose deaths nearly tripled during 1999–2014. In 2014, among 47,055 drug overdose deaths, 61% involved an opioid. During 2013–2014, deaths associated with the most commonly prescribed opioids (natural/semisynthetic opioids) continued to increase slightly; however, the rapid increase in deaths appears to be driven by heroin and synthetic opioids other than methadone.What is added by this report?From 2014 to 2015, the death rate from synthetic opioids other than methadone, which includes fentanyl, increased by 72.2%, and heroin death rates increased by 20.6%. Rates of death involving heroin and synthetic opioids other than methadone increased across all demographic groups, regions, and in numerous states. Natural/semisynthetic opioid death rates increased by 2.6%, whereas, methadone death rates decreased by 9.1%.What are the implications for public health practice?There is an urgent need for a multifaceted, collaborative public health and law enforcement approach to the opioid epidemic, including implementing the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain; improving access to and use of prescription drug monitoring programs; expanding naloxone distribution; enhancing opioid use disorder treatment capacity and linkage into treatment, including medication-assisted treatment; implementing harm reduction approaches, such as syringe services program; and supporting law enforcement strategies to reduce the illicit opioid supply.The U.S. opioid epidemic is continuing, and drug overdose deaths nearly tripled during 1999–2014. Among 47,055 drug overdose deaths that occurred in 2014 in the United States, 28,647  involved an opioid . Illicit opioids are contributing to the increase in opioid overdose deaths . In an effort to target prevention strategies to address the rapidly changing epidemic, CDC examined overall drug overdose death rates during 2010–2015 and opioid overdose death rates during 2014–2015 by subcategories (natural/semisynthetic opioids, methadone, heroin, and synthetic opioids other than methadone).* Rates were stratified by demographics, region, and by 28 states with high quality reporting on death certificates of specific drugs involved in overdose deaths. During 2015, drug overdoses accounted for 52,404 U.S. deaths, including 33,091  that involved an opioid. There has been progress in preventing methadone deaths, and death rates declined by 9.1%. However, rates of deaths involving other opioids, specifically heroin and synthetic opioids other than methadone (likely driven primarily by illicitly manufactured fentanyl) , increased sharply overall and across many states. A multifaceted, collaborative public health and law enforcement approach is urgently needed. Response efforts include implementing the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain , improving access to and use of prescription drug monitoring programs, enhancing naloxone distribution and other harm reduction approaches, increasing opioid use disorder treatment capacity, improving linkage into treatment, and supporting law enforcement strategies to reduce the illicit opioid supply.The National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files were used to record drug overdose deaths.† Drug overdose deaths were identified using the International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), based on the ICD-10 underlying cause-of-death codes X40–44 (unintentional), X60–64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10–Y14 (undetermined intent). Among deaths with drug overdose as the underlying cause, the type of opioid is indicated by the following ICD-10 multiple cause-of-death codes: opioids (T40.0, T40.1, T40.2, T40.3, T40.4, or T40.6); natural/semisynthetic opioids (T40.2); methadone (T40.3); synthetic opioids other than methadone (T40.4); and heroin (T40.1). Some deaths involved more than one type of opioid; these deaths were included in the rates for each subcategory. Therefore, categories of deaths presented are not mutually exclusive.§Changes in drug overdose death rates were analyzed for all 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC) from 2010 to 2015 using joinpoint regression.¶ Opioid overdose death rates were examined for the period 2014–2015 by subcategories (natural/semisynthetic opioids, methadone, heroin, and synthetic opioids other than methadone) and by demographics, region, and across states. State-level analyses were conducted for 28 states meeting the following criteria: 1) >80% of drug overdose death certificates named at least one specific drug in 2014; 2) change from 2014 to 2015 in the percentage of death certificates reporting at least one specific drug was <10 percentage points**; and 3) ≥20 deaths occurred during 2014 and 2015 in at least two opioid subcategories examined. Analyses comparing changes in age-adjusted death rates from 2014 to 2015 used z-tests when deaths were ≥100 and nonoverlapping confidence intervals based on a gamma distribution when deaths were <100.††The drug overdose death rate increased significantly from 12.3 per 100,000 population in 2010 to 16.3 in 2015. Death rates increased in 30 states and DC and remained stable in 19 states (Figure). Two states had changing trends during this period of decreasing rates followed by increases.§§ During 2015, a total of 52,404 persons in the United States died from a drug overdose, an increase from 47,055 in 2014; among these deaths, 33,091  involved an opioid, an increase from 28,647 in 2014. The age-adjusted opioid-involved death rate increased by 15.6%, from 9.0 per 100,000 in 2014 to 10.4 in 2015, driven largely by increases in deaths involving heroin and synthetic opioids other than methadone. Death rates for natural/semisynthetic opioids, heroin, and synthetic opioids other than methadone increased by 2.6%, 20.6%, and 72.2%, respectively  . Methadone death rates decreased by 9.1% .During 2014–2015, rates of natural/semisynthetic opioid deaths increased among males overall, both sexes aged 25–44 years, and non-Hispanic whites. Methadone death rates decreased among males and females overall, but increased among persons aged ≥65 years . Death rates involving heroin and synthetic opioids other than methadone increased in both males and females, persons aged ≥15 years, and all racial/ethnic populations; however, heroin death rates among males aged 15–24 years remained stable. In 2015, death rates involving synthetic opioids other than methadone were highest among males aged 25–44 years , increasing 102.3% from 2014 to 2015 . Heroin death rates also were highest in this demographic group , increasing 22.2% from 2014 to 2015. Natural/semisynthetic opioid death rates increased in the Northeast and South U.S. Census regions, and methadone death rates decreased in the South . Death rates involving synthetic opioids other than methadone and heroin increased in all regions from 2014 to 2015 .Among the 28 states meeting inclusion criteria for state-level analyses, 16  experienced increases in death rates involving synthetic opioids other than methadone, and 11  experienced increases in heroin death rates from 2014 to 2015. The largest absolute rate change in deaths from synthetic opioids other than methadone occurred in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Ohio, Rhode Island and West Virginia. The largest percentage increases in rates occurred in New York , Connecticut  and Illinois  . Connecticut, Massachusetts, Ohio, and West Virginia experienced the largest absolute rate changes in heroin deaths, while the largest percentage increases in rates occurred in South Carolina , North Carolina , and Tennessee  . Three states (New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Virginia) experienced decreases in natural/semi-synthetic opioid death rates, while increases occurred in five states (Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, and Tennessee) .During 2010–2015, the rate of drug overdose deaths in the United States increased in 30 states and DC, remained stable in 19 states, and showed decreasing trends followed by increases in two states.§§,¶¶ From 2014 to 2015, drug overdose deaths increased by 5,349 , signifying a continuing trend observed since 1999 . Opioid death rates increased by 15.6% from 2014 to 2015. These significant increases in death rates were driven by synthetic opioids other than methadone , most likely illicitly-manufactured fentanyl , and heroin . Increases in these opioid subcategories occurred overall and across all demographics and regions. Natural/semisynthetic opioid death rates increased by 2.6%, whereas methadone death rates decreased by 9.1%.These findings are consistent with recent reports highlighting the increasing trend in deaths involving heroin and synthetic opioids other than methadone . The number of deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone have been associated with the number of drug products obtained by law enforcement testing positive for fentanyl, but not with fentanyl prescribing rates . A recent report found that these increases, likely attributable to illicitly manufactured fentanyl, were concentrated in eight of 27 states examined .The decline in methadone death rates, a trend observed since 2008, followed efforts to reduce methadone use for pain, including Food and Drug Administration warnings, limits on high dose formulations, and clinical guidelines . The small increase in natural/semisynthetic opioid death rates illustrates an ongoing problem with prescription opioids; however, the increase has slowed from 2013–2014, potentially because of policy and health system changes, required prescription drug monitoring program review, legislative changes in naloxone distribution, and prescribing guidelines .***The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, factors related to death investigation might affect rate estimates involving specific drugs. At autopsy, the substances tested for, and circumstances under which tests are performed to determine which drugs are present, might vary by jurisdiction and over time. Second, the percentage of deaths with specific drugs identified on the death certificate varies by jurisdiction and over time. Nationally, 19% (in 2014) and 17% (in 2015) of drug overdose death certificates did not include the specific types of drugs involved. Additionally, the percentage of drug overdose deaths with specific drugs identified on the death certificate varies widely by state, ranging from 47.4% to 99%. Variations in reporting across states prevent comparison of rates between states. Third, improvements in testing and reporting of specific drugs might have contributed to some observed increases in opioid-involved death rates. Fourth, because heroin and morphine are metabolized similarly , some heroin deaths might have been misclassified as morphine deaths, resulting in underreporting of heroin deaths. Finally, the state-specific analyses of opioid deaths are restricted to 28 states, limiting generalizability.The ongoing epidemic of opioid deaths requires intense attention and action. In a November 2016 report, the Drug Enforcement Administration referred to prescription drugs, heroin, and fentanyl as the most significant drug-related threats to the United States.††† The misuse of prescription opioids is intertwined with that of illicit opioids; data have demonstrated that nonmedical use of prescription opioids is a significant risk factor for heroin use , underscoring the need for continued prevention efforts around prescription opioids. Intensifying efforts to distribute naloxone (an antidote to reverse an opioid overdose), enhancing access to treatment, including medication-assisted treatment, and implementing harm reduction services are urgently needed. It is important to focus efforts on expanding opioid disorder treatment capacity, including medication-assisted treatment and improving linkage into treatment.§§§ Implementing harm reduction approaches, such as the scaling up comprehensive syringe services programs can reach persons with opioid use disorders and provide them with access to naloxone and medication-assisted treatment, reduce transmission risk for human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis C, and reduce other harms from drug use. Law enforcement strategies to reduce the illicit opioid supply must also be supported. A recent report did not find evidence that efforts to reduce opioid prescribing were leading to heroin overdoses; rather, such policies could help reduce the number of persons who are exposed to opioids . Continued improvements in guideline-recommended opioid prescribing practices for chronic pain , increased improving access to and use of prescription drug monitoring programs, and increased utilization of nonopioid pain treatments are needed. A multifaceted, coordinated approach between public health and public safety is also necessary to address the U.S. opioid epidemic.Corresponding authors: Rose A.

In 2016, 66.4% of the 63,632 drug overdose deaths involved an opioid.What is added by this report?In 2017, among 70,237 drug overdose deaths, 47,600  involved opioids, with increases across age groups, racial/ethnic groups, county urbanization levels, and in multiple states. From 2013 to 2017, synthetic opioids contributed to increases in drug overdose death rates in several states. From 2016 to 2017, synthetic opioid-involved overdose death rates increased 45.2%.What are the implications for public health practice?Continued federal, state, and local surveillance efforts to inform evidence-based prevention, response, and treatment strategies and to strengthen public health and public safety partnerships are urgently needed.The 63,632 drug overdose deaths in the United States in 2016 represented a 21.4% increase from 2015; two thirds of these deaths involved an opioid . From 2015 to 2016, drug overdose deaths increased in all drug categories examined; the largest increase occurred among deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone (synthetic opioids), which includes illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF) . Since 2013, driven largely by IMF, including fentanyl analogs , the current wave of the opioid overdose epidemic has been marked by increases in deaths involving synthetic opioids. IMF has contributed to increases in overdose deaths, with geographic differences reported . CDC examined state-level changes in death rates involving all drug overdoses in 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC) and those involving synthetic opioids in 20 states, during 2013–2017. In addition, changes in death rates from 2016 to 2017 involving all opioids and opioid subcategories,* were examined by demographics, county urbanization levels, and by 34 states and DC. Among 70,237 drug overdose deaths in 2017, 47,600  involved an opioid.† From 2013 to 2017, drug overdose death rates increased in 35 of 50 states and DC, and significant increases in death rates involving synthetic opioids occurred in 15 of 20 states, likely driven by IMF . From 2016 to 2017, overdose deaths involving all opioids and synthetic opioids increased, but deaths involving prescription opioids and heroin remained stable. The opioid overdose epidemic continues to worsen and evolve because of the continuing increase in deaths involving synthetic opioids. Provisional data from 2018 indicate potential improvements in some drug overdose indicators;§ however, analysis of final data from 2018 is necessary for confirmation. More timely and comprehensive surveillance data are essential to inform efforts to prevent and respond to opioid overdoses; intensified prevention and response measures are urgently needed to curb deaths involving prescription and illicit opioids, specifically IMF.Drug overdose deaths were identified in the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files,¶ with death certificate data coded using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes X40–44 (unintentional), X60–64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10–Y14 (undetermined intent). Among deaths with drug overdose as the underlying cause, the type of drug or drug category is indicated by the following ICD-10 multiple cause-of-death codes: opioids (T40.0, T40.1, T40.2, T40.3, T40.4, or T40.6)**; natural/semisynthetic opioids (T40.2); methadone (T40.3); heroin (T40.1); synthetic opioids other than methadone (T40.4); cocaine (T40.5); and psychostimulants with abuse potential (T43.6).†† Some deaths involved more than one type of drug, and these were included in rates for each drug category; thus, categories are not mutually exclusive.§§Annual percent change with statistically significant trends in age-adjusted drug overdose death rates¶¶ for all 50 states and DC from 2013 to 2017 and in age-adjusted death rates involving synthetic opioids for 20 states that met drug specificity criteria*** were analyzed using Joinpoint regression.††† Age-adjusted overdose death rates were examined from 2016 to 2017 for all opioids, prescription opioids , heroin, and synthetic opioids. Death rates were stratified by age, sex, racial/ethnic group, urbanization level,§§§ and state. State-level analyses included DC and 34 states with adequate drug specificity data for 2016 and 2017.¶¶¶ Analyses comparing changes in death rates from 2016 to 2017 used z-tests when the number of deaths was ≥100 and nonoverlapping confidence intervals based on a gamma distribution when the number was <100.****Drug overdoses resulted in 70,237 deaths during 2017; among these, 47,600  involved opioids , representing a 12.0% rate increase from 2016 . Synthetic opioids were involved in 59.8% of all opioid-involved overdose deaths; the rate increased by 45.2% from 2016 to 2017 . From 2013 through 2017, overdose death rates increased significantly in 35 states and DC; 15 of 20 states that met drug specificity criteria had significant increases in overdose death rates involving synthetic opioids (Figure). From 2016 to 2017, death rates involving cocaine and psychostimulants increased 34.4% (from 3.2 to 4.3 per 100,000) and 33.3% (from 2.4 to 3.2 per 100,000), respectively, likely contributing to increases in drug overdose deaths; however, rates remained stable for deaths involving prescription opioids   and heroin  .From 2016 to 2017, opioid-involved overdose deaths increased among males and females and among persons aged ≥25 years, non-Hispanic whites (whites), non-Hispanic blacks (blacks), and Hispanics . The largest relative change occurred among blacks , and the largest absolute rate increase was among males aged 25–44 years (an increase of 4.6 per 100,000). The largest relative change among age groups was for persons aged ≥65 years . Counties in medium metro areas experienced the largest absolute rate increase (an increase of 1.9 per 100,000), and the largest relative rate increase occurred in micropolitan counties . Death rates increased significantly in 15 states, with the largest relative changes in North Carolina , Ohio , and Maine .From 2016 to 2017, the prescription opioid-involved death rate decreased 13.2% among males aged 15–24 years but increased 10.5% among persons aged ≥65 years . These death rates remained stable from 2016 to 2017 across all racial groups and urbanization levels and in most states, although five states (Maine, Maryland, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Washington) experienced significant decreases, and one (Illinois) had a significant increase. The largest relative changes included a 29.7% increase in Illinois and a 39.2% decrease in Maine. The highest prescription opioid-involved death rates in 2017 were in West Virginia , Maryland , and Utah .Heroin-involved overdose death rates declined among many groups in 2017 compared with those in 2016 . The largest declines occurred among persons aged 15–24 years , particularly males , as well as in medium metro counties . Rates declined 3.2% among whites. However, heroin-involved overdose death rates did increase among some groups; the largest relative rate increase occurred among persons aged ≥65 years  and 55–64 years  and among blacks . Rates remained stable in most states, with significant decreases in five states (Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, and Ohio), and increases in three (California, Illinois, and Virginia). The largest relative decrease  was in Ohio, and the largest relative increase  was in Virginia. The highest heroin-involved overdose death rates in 2017 were in DC , West Virginia , and Connecticut .Deaths involving synthetic opioids propelled increases from 2016 to 2017 across all demographic categories . The highest death rate was in males aged 25–44 years , and the largest relative increases occurred among blacks  and American Indian/Alaska Natives . Deaths increased across all urbanization levels from 2016 to 2017. Twenty-three states and DC experienced significant increases in synthetic opioid-involved overdose death rates, including eight states west of the Mississippi River. The largest relative rate increase occurred in Arizona , followed by North Carolina  and Oregon . The highest synthetic opioid-involved overdose death rates in 2017 were in West Virginia , Ohio , and New Hampshire .In the United States, drug overdoses resulted in 702,568 deaths during 1999–2017, with 399,230  involving opioids.†††† From 2016 to 2017, death rates from all opioids increased, with increases driven by synthetic opioids. Deaths involving IMF have been seen primarily east of the Mississippi River;§§§§ however, recent increases occurred in eight states west of the Mississippi River, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Minnesota, Missouri, Oregon, Texas, and Washington.Drug overdose death rates from 2013 to 2017 increased in most states; the influence of synthetic opioids on these rate increases was seen in approximately one quarter of all states during this same 5-year period. Overdose deaths involving cocaine and psychostimulants also have increased in recent years . Overall, the overdose epidemic continues to worsen, and it has grown increasingly complex by co-involvement of prescription and illicit drugs .¶¶¶¶ For example, in 2016, synthetic opioids (primarily IMF) were involved in 23.7% of deaths involving prescription opioids, 37.4% involving heroin, and 40.3% involving cocaine . In addition, death rates are increasing across multiple demographic groups. For example, although death rates involving opioids remained highest among whites, relatively large increases across several drug categories were observed among blacks.The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, at autopsy, substances tested for vary by time and jurisdiction, and improvements in toxicologic testing might account for some reported increases. Second, the specific types of drugs involved were not included on 15% of drug overdose death certificates in 2016 and 12% in 2017, and the percentage of death certificates with at least one drug specified ranged among states from 54.7%–99.3% in 2017, limiting rate comparisons between states. Third, because heroin and morphine are metabolized similarly , some heroin deaths might have been misclassified as morphine deaths, resulting in underreporting of heroin deaths. Fourth, potential race misclassification might have led to underestimates for certain categories, primarily for American Indian/Alaska Natives and Asian/Pacific Islanders.***** Finally, most state-specific analyses were restricted to DC and a subset of states with adequate drug specificity, limiting generalizability.Through 2017, the drug overdose epidemic continues to worsen and evolve, and the involvement of many types of drugs (e.g., opioids, cocaine, and methamphetamine) underscores the urgency to obtain more timely and local data to inform public health and public safety action. Although prescription opioid- and heroin-involved death rates were stable from 2016 to 2017, they remained high. Some preliminary indicators in 2018 point to possible improvements based on provisional data;††††† however, confirmation will depend on results of pending medical investigations and analysis of final data. Overall, deaths involving synthetic opioids continue to drive increases in overdose deaths. CDC funds 32 states and DC to collect more timely and comprehensive drug overdose data, including improved toxicologic testing in opioid-involved fatal overdoses.§§§§§ CDC is funding prevention activities in 42 states and DC.¶¶¶¶¶ CDC also is leveraging emergency funding to support 49 states, DC, and four territories to broaden their surveillance and response capabilities and enable comprehensive community-level responses with implementation of novel, evidence-based interventions.****** Continued efforts to ensure safe prescribing practices by following the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain†††††† are enhanced by access to nonopioid and nonpharmacologic treatments for pain. Other important activities include increasing naloxone availability, expanding access to medication-assisted treatment, enhancing public health and public safety partnerships, and maximizing the ability of health systems to link persons to treatment and harm-reduction services.Rose Rudd, MSPH, Division of Unintentional Injury Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, CDC.Corresponding authors: Lawrence Scholl, lzi8@cdc.gov, 404-498-1489; Puja Seth, pseth@cdc.gov, 404-639-6334.1Division of Unintentional Injury Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, CDC.All authors have completed and submitted the ICMJE form for disclosure of potential conflicts of interest.

Nonoverlapping confidence intervals based on the gamma method were used if the number of deaths was <100 in 2016 or 2017, and z-tests were used if the number of deaths was ≥100 in both 2016 and 2017. Note that the method of comparing confidence intervals is a conservative method for statistical significance; caution should be observed when interpreting a nonsignificant difference when the lower and upper limits being compared overlap only slightly. Confidence intervals of 2016 and 2017 rates of synthetic opioid-involved deaths in Iowa overlapped only slightly: , .*** Statistically significant (P-value <0.05).††† Cells with ≤9 deaths are not reported. Rates based on <20 deaths are not considered reliable and are not reported.* Rates shown are the number of deaths per 100,000 population. Age-adjusted death rates were calculated by applying age-specific death rates to the 2000 U.S. standard population age distribution.† Deaths are classified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD–10). Left panel includes drug overdose deaths identified using underlying cause-of-death codes X40–X44, X60–X64, X85, and Y10–Y14. Right panel includes drug overdose deaths, as defined, that have synthetic opioids other than methadone (T40.4) as a contributing cause.§ State-level analyses of overdose rates for deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone included 20 states that met the following criteria: 1) >80% of drug overdose death certificates named at least one specific drug in 2013–2017; 2) change from 2013 to 2017 in the percentage of death certificates reporting at least one specific drug was <10 percentage points; and 3) ≥20 deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone occurred each year during 2013–2017. States whose reporting of any specific drug or drugs involved in an overdose changed by ≥10 percentage points from 2013 to 2017 were excluded because drug-specific overdose numbers and rates might have changed substantially from 2013 to 2017 as a result of changes in reporting.¶ Left panel: Joinpoint regression examining changes in trends from 2013 to 2017 indicated that 35 states and the District of Columbia had significant increases in drug overdose death rates from 2013 to 2017 (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin). All remaining states had nonsignificant trends during this period. Right panel: Joinpoint regression examining changes in trends from 2013 to 2017 indicated that 15 states had significant increases in death rates for overdoses involving synthetic opioids other than methadone from 2013 to 2017 (Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin). The five remaining states analyzed had nonsignificant trends during this period. Significant increases in trends were not detected in some states with large absolute increases in death rates from 2013 to 2017 because of limited power to detect significant effects."
"Invasive Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Infections Among Persons Who Inject Drugs — Six Sites, 2005–2016",https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6722a2.htm," June 8, 2018 ",['https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/statistics/2015surveillance/commentary.htm'],"What is already known about this topic?The ongoing opioid epidemic is associated with increases in human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C infections and infection syndromes such as endocarditis.What is added by this report?Persons who inject drugs were an estimated 16.3 times more likely to develop invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections than others. Invasive MRSA from injecting drugs increased from 4.1% of invasive MRSA cases to 9.2% .What are the implications for public health practice?Increases in nonsterile injection drug use can cause increases in MRSA infections, underscoring the importance of public health interventions, including prevention of opioid misuse, providing medication-assisted treatment, syringe services programs, and education on safer injection practices to prevent infections from skin flora. 
 
In the United States, age-adjusted opioid overdose death rates increased by >200% during 1999–2015, and heroin overdose death rates increased nearly 300% during 2011–2015 . During 2011–2013, the rate of heroin use within the past year among U.S. residents aged ≥12 years increased 62.5% overall and 114.3% among non-Hispanic whites, compared with 2002–2004 . Increases in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections related to increases in injection drug use have been recently highlighted ; likewise, invasive bacterial infections, including endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and skin and soft tissue infections, have increased in areas where the opioid epidemic is expanding . To assess the effects of the opioid epidemic on invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections during 2005–2016, surveillance data from CDC’s Emerging Infections Program (EIP) were analyzed . Persons who inject drugs were estimated to be 16.3 times more likely to develop invasive MRSA infections than others. The proportion of invasive MRSA cases that occurred among persons who inject drugs increased from 4.1% in 2011 to 9.2% in 2016. Infection types were frequently those associated with nonsterile injection drug use. Continued increases in nonsterile injection drug use are likely to result in increases in invasive MRSA infections, underscoring the importance of public health measures to curb the opioid epidemic.Active, population-, and laboratory-based surveillance data collected through the Healthcare-Associated Infections/Community Interface (HAIC) component of CDC’s EIP during 2005–2016 were analyzed to assess the effects of the opioid epidemic on invasive MRSA infection. A case was defined as the isolation of MRSA from a normally sterile site (e.g., blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or bone) from a surveillance area resident. National invasive MRSA disease prevalence (adjusted for age, race, sex, and dialysis) among persons aged ≥13 years who inject drugs and among persons aged ≥13 years who do not inject drugs were estimated for 2011 from EIP/HAIC data using a previously described method ; invasive MRSA rates per 100,000 persons in both groups (and the corresponding rate ratio) were calculated in conjunction with a published population point estimate of the U.S. population aged ≥13 years who injected drugs in the previous year for 2011 . The six-site surveillance area used for the remainder of this report included California (three counties); Connecticut (statewide); Georgia (eight counties); and Minnesota, New York, and Tennessee (one county each). Demographic characteristics and clinical diagnoses of invasive MRSA cases among persons who inject drugs were compared with those among persons who do not inject drugs. The proportion of invasive MRSA cases that occurred among persons who injected drugs (among all invasive MRSA cases) was calculated overall and by site for each year; significance of trends was analyzed using linear regression. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.Among invasive MRSA cases occurring in persons who inject drugs, demographics and health care–associated risk factors for cases ascertained during 2005–2010 were compared with those that occurred during 2011–2016 to describe changes over time. Health care–associated risk factors include specimen collection for culture >3 days after hospital admission; dialysis, hospitalization, surgery, or long-term care residency in the 12 months preceding culture; and/or presence of a central venous catheter ≤2 days before invasive MRSA culture collection. Cases among persons with none of these risk factors were considered community-associated. Trends in the proportion of invasive MRSA cases that occurred among persons who inject drugs also were assessed in three sites that reported data from 2005–2014 only (Colorado and Maryland [one county each]; Oregon [three counties]).Among 39,050 invasive MRSA cases reported from six sites during 2005–2016, a total of 2,093  occurred in persons who injected drugs. The estimated rate of invasive MRSA among persons aged ≥13 years who injected drugs in the previous year was 472.2 per 100,000 in 2011, and the estimated rate among persons aged ≥13 who did not inject drugs in the previous year was 29.0 per 100,000 (rate ratio [RR] = 16.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 15.7–16.8). Overall, cases of invasive MRSA among persons who inject drugs were more likely than cases among persons who did not inject drugs to occur in persons who were younger (median age = 45 versus 63 years; p<0.05) and to be community-associated infections (odds ratio [OR] = 4.4, 95% CI = 4.0–4.8). Clinical diagnoses frequently associated with injection drug use were more common among patients with invasive MRSA who injected drugs than among those who did not (Table), including septic embolism, endocarditis, abscess (skin and internal), cellulitis, and osteomyelitis.The proportion of invasive MRSA cases that occurred among persons who inject drugs approximately doubled in some sites (counties in Connecticut, Georgia, Minnesota, and Tennessee) after 2011. In the six-site catchment area, the percentage of invasive MRSA cases among persons who inject drugs declined from 6.4% in 2005 to 3.5% in 2010 (p<0.05), but subsequently increased steadily to 9.2% in 2016 (p<0.05) (Figure). Among invasive MRSA cases that occurred among persons who inject drugs, cases during 2011–2016 were more likely to occur in persons who were white (OR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.4–2.0) and be community-associated (OR = 1.3; 95% CI = 1.1–1.6) than were cases during 2005–2010. In two of three sites (Colorado and Oregon) that reported data from 2005–2014 only, similar increases in the proportion of invasive MRSA cases that occurred among persons who inject drugs after an initial decrease  were observed.In six sites, invasive MRSA infections disproportionately affected persons who inject drugs. In this analysis, invasive MRSA infections that occurred among persons who inject drugs were those frequently associated with nonsterile injection drug use; demographic shifts in the population of invasive MRSA infections among injection drug users mirror those observed in the ongoing opioid epidemic, such as the increased proportion of cases among whites. A decline and subsequent rise in the proportion of invasive MRSA cases among persons who inject drugs was observed in the six-site catchment area during 2005–2016 and in two additional sites for which data were available through 2014; similar patterns were seen in the incidence of acute HCV* and in the rate of drug overdose deaths involving heroin , with notable increases in both beginning around 2010.The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, injection drug use status in medical records is possibly misclassified, which could result in an under- or overestimation of the percentage of MRSA infections in injection drug users. Second, rates were based on national estimates of both invasive MRSA case counts and the population of persons who inject drugs that might not be accurate. Third, the rates are based on 2011 data because this is the only year for which population estimates for the number of persons who inject drugs is available. This might be an underestimate if current injection drug use practices are higher risk. Fourth, site-specific counts of persons who inject drugs were not available, precluding the calculation of site-specific rates. Finally, invasive methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus surveillance began in 2016 and could not be included in this report to describe the impact of the opioid epidemic on these infections.Although much attention has focused on the transmission of blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and hepatitis B and C viruses related to injection drug use, infections from skin flora such as Staphylococcus aureus are also important and might not be prevented solely by programs focused on preventing blood-borne pathogen transmission. Increases in nonsterile injection drug use are likely to result in increases in the occurrence of invasive MRSA infections among persons who inject drugs, underscoring the importance of public health measures to curb the opioid epidemic. Effective interventions include primary prevention of opioid misuse through guideline-concordant opioid prescribing; treatment of opioid use disorder with medication-assisted therapies; community-based comprehensive syringe services programs that provide access to sterile equipment used to inject drugs and its safe disposal; and education on safer injection practices, wound care, and early warning signs of serious infections associated with injection drug use.Shirley Zhang, Anthony Fiore, Shelley Magill, CDC; Emerging Infections Programs (EIP), CDC; Erin Epson, David Lopez-Rodriguez, Gretchen Rothrock, California EIP; Deborah Aragon, Claire Reisenauer, Colorado EIP; Carmen Marquez, Daniel Wurm, Connecticut EIP; Monica Farley, Amy Tunali, Stepy Thomas, Rahsaan Overton, Tori Dusse, Georgia EIP; Joanne Benton, Lindsay Bonner, Rosemary Hollick, Terresa Carter, Kathleen Shutt, Michelle Wilson, Maryland EIP; Kathy Como-Sabetti, Carmen Bernu, MacKenzie Koeck, Minnesota EIP; Christina Felsen, Anita Gellert, New York EIP; Heather Jamieson, Tasha Poissant, Mark Schmidt, Jamie Thompson, Oregon EIP; Danielle Ndi, Katie Dyer, Karen Leib, Tiffanie Markus, Brenda Barnes, Tennessee EIP.
