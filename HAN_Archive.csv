CDCHAN-00384
Summary
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) are investigating recent increases in fentanyl-related unintentional overdose fatalities in multiple states across the U.S. The purpose of this HAN advisory is to: (1) alert public health departments, health care providers, first responders, and medical examiners and coroners to the possibility of additional increases in other jurisdictions, (2) provide recommendations for improving detection of fentanyl-related overdose outbreaks and (3) encourage states to expand access to naloxone and training for administering naloxone to reduce opioid overdose deaths.
Background
Fentanyl, a synthetic and short-acting opioid analgesic, is 50-100 times more potent than morphine and approved for managing acute or chronic pain associated with advanced cancer.
 Although pharmaceutical fentanyl can be diverted for misuse, most cases of fentanyl-related morbidity and mortality have been linked to illicitly manufactured fentanyl and fentanyl analogs, collectively referred to as non-pharmaceutical fentanyl (NPF).
 NPF is sold via illicit drug markets for its heroin-like effect and often mixed with heroin and/or cocaine as a combination product—with or without the user’s knowledge—to increase its euphoric effects. While NPF-related overdoses can be reversed with naloxone, a higher dose or multiple number of doses per overdose event may be required to revive a patient due to the high potency of NPF. 
In March 2015, DEA issued a nationwide alert identifying fentanyl as a threat to public health and safety. 
  This was followed by a DEA National Heroin Threat Assessment Summary, which noted that “beginning in late 2013 and throughout 2014, several states have reported spikes in overdose deaths due to fentanyl and its analog acetyl-fentanyl.” 
 Similar to previous fentanyl overdose outbreaks, most of the more than 700 fentanyl-related overdose deaths reported to DEA during this timeframe were attributable to illicitly-manufactured fentanyl—not diverted pharmaceutical fentanyl—and either mixed with heroin or other diluents and sold as a highly potent form (sometimes under the street name “China White”). The DEA report noted that the “true number is most likely higher because “many coroners’ offices and state crime laboratories do not test for fentanyl or its analogs unless given a specific reason to do so.”
Reports on state drug seizures (or confiscations) from the National Forensic Laboratory Information System (NFLIS), a program of the DEA’s Office of Diversion Control, indicate a significant increase in the total number of fentanyl drug seizures reported by forensic laboratories around the country from 2012 to 2014 (618 in 2012; 945 in 2013; 4,585 in 2014).
  More than 80% of drug seizures in 2014 were concentrated in 10 states (Table 1). The number of states reporting 20 or more fentanyl seizures every six months is increasing. From July to December 2014, 18 states reported 20 or more fentanyl drug seizures (See Figure 1). Previously, six states reported 20 or more fentanyl drug seizures from July to December 2013.
Table 1: Top 10 states by total Fentanyl Seizures, 2014, unpublished NFLIS data
Figure 1:
These increases raise serious concerns for public health if fentanyl seizures serve as a proxy for increased overdose risk.  Recent fentanyl-related fatal overdose data from several of the top 10 states with highest seizure counts suggest fatalities have increased in states reporting large increases in fentanyl seizures.  Two of the top-five states, Ohio and Maryland, both reported sharp increases in fentanyl-related deaths in 2014—Ohio reported 514 fentanyl-related fatal overdoses in 2014 compared to 92 in 2013,
 and Maryland reported 185 fentanyl-related fatal overdoses in 2014 compared to 58 in 2013
.  Massachusetts, another top-five state, is currently investigating whether an abnormally sharp increase in opioid-related deaths in 2014 is attributable to fentanyl.
 Florida, another state reporting increases in fentanyl-related drug seizures, recently reported 397 fatal overdoses attributable to fentanyl in 2014, up from 185 in 2013
Fentanyl poses a significant danger to public health workers, first responders, and law enforcement personnel that may unwittingly come into contact with it either by absorbing through the skin or accidental inhalation of airborne powder.  In August 2015, New Jersey law enforcement officers conducting a narcotics field test on an illicit substance experienced shortness of breath, dizziness, and respiratory distress after coming into contact with an unknown substance, which forensic laboratory testing determined to be a mix of cocaine, heroin, and fentanyl.
Recommendations
CDC suggests the following actions in response to increases in fentanyl-related overdose deaths:
Improve detection of fentanyl outbreaks
 to facilitate effective response.

Public health departments
: Explore methods for more rapidly detecting drug overdose outbreaks, including fentanyl.
Use existing surveillance systems such as medical examiner data, emergency medical services data or near real-time emergency department data
In outbreak situations of dramatically increased opioid overdose, at sentinel sites, or in jurisdictions with high drug overdose burden, consider asking emergency departments to report fatal and nonfatal opioid overdose cases to them within 48 hours.
 This may be a resource-intensive approach. 
Consider engaging local poison centers to assist with tracking and treatment of patients.
Review data on drug seizures involving fentanyl or acetyl-fentanyl within the jurisdiction such as those published by National Forensic Laboratory Information System (NFLIS) to stay abreast of geographic changes in supply (see 
NFLIS Report
Cdc-pdf
External
).
Identify and track decedent demographics and risk factors (e.g., drug type and route of administration) along with geographic concentrations of cases to better inform public health surveillance and overdose prevention efforts.
Medical examiners and coroners:
 Screen for fentanyl in suspected opioid overdose cases in regions reporting increases in fentanyl seizures, fentanyl-related overdose fatalities or unusually high spikes in heroin or unspecified drug overdose fatalities. Not all jurisdictions routinely test for fentanyl.

Screen specimens from fatal drug overdose deaths using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA test) with the capacity to detect fentanyl. If an ELISA test is positive for fentanyl, conduct confirmatory testing by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). If no fentanyl is detected by GC/MS, then fentanyl analogs should be suspected and subsequent testing considered.
Implement standardized mechanisms for determining cause of death and methods of reporting to ensure death reports are complete and accurate.
 SAMHSA has published consensus recommendations for uniform standards and case definitions for classifying opioid-related deaths (See 
Consensus Recommendations
External
). It is especially important to include the word “fentanyl” on the death certificate when the drug is a contributing cause of death.
Law enforcement:
 Law enforcement can play an important role identifying and responding to increases in the distribution and use of illicitly manufactured fentanyl.

Investigating officers are advised to consider the potential exposure to fentanyl through skin exposure and/or inhalation of aerosolized drug, and utilize appropriate safety precautions and personal protective equipment
Test drug samples seized or collected by law enforcement or found at the scene of death to detect fentanyl or fentanyl analogs.
Prioritize and expedite testing of drug samples taken from drug overdose scenes, if possible.
Share data on fentanyl and acetyl-fentanyl drug seizures with local health departments, coroners, and medical examiners.
Expand Use of Naloxone:
 Naloxone is a safe and effective antidote to all opioid-related overdoses, including heroin and fentanyl, and is a critical tool in preventing fatal opioid overdoses.
  Depending on state and local laws, this medication can potentially be administered effectively by EMS, law enforcement
, people at high risk for overdose
, or family and friend bystanders who have obtained the medication
Health Care Providers
: Multiple doses of naloxone may need to be administered per overdose event because of fentanyl’s increased potency relative to other opioids.
 
Increase the amount of naloxone on hand for first responders such as law enforcement and other EMS personnel given the increased amount needed and rate of use during a fentanyl outbreak
Recognize and treat opioid overdose patients, with particular focus on how to respond to fentanyl and acetyl fentanyl overdose.
Harm reduction organizations:
 Expand naloxone access to persons at risk for opioid-related overdose and their family members.
Provide take-home naloxone kits and encourage people who use heroin and/or misuse opioid analgesics—or know people that do—to carry them.
Train those using drugs how to effectively administer naloxone and emphasize the importance of overdose prevention tactics, such as rescue breathing and calling 911.","['https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6234a5.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5729a1.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6324a3.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6234a5.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5729a1.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6324a3.htm']"

As a follow-up to
 
HAN 00382
 
(distributed September 11, 2015), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are providing this update to rescind the following recommendation: If healthcare facilities contract maintenance and repair of these devices to third-party vendors, healthcare facilities should verify that these vendors are approved or certified by the manufacturer to provide those services. We are making this change because there are currently no formal standardized programs or processes through which all manufacturers certify third-party vendors. We are also further clarifying that healthcare facilities which hire contractors to perform device reprocessing should verify that the contractor has an appropriate training program (i.e., consistent with what would be required in the healthcare facility) and that the training program includes the specific devices used by the healthcare facility.
Summary
On September 11, 2015, CDC issued 
HAN 00382
 alerting healthcare providers and facilities about the public health need to properly maintain, clean, and disinfect or sterilize reusable medical devices. Recent infection control lapses due to non-compliance with recommended reprocessing procedures highlight a critical gap in patient safety. Healthcare facilities (e.g., hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, clinics, and doctors’ offices) that utilize reusable medical devices are urged to immediately review current reprocessing practices at their facility to ensure they (1) are complying with all steps as directed by the device manufacturers, and (2) have in place appropriate policies and procedures that are consistent with current standards and guidelines.
After considering feedback from vendors that perform servicing and repair of reusable medical devices, we are amending HAN Advisory 382 to remove the following sentence: “If healthcare facilities contract maintenance and repair of these devices to third-party vendors, healthcare facilities should verify that these vendors are approved or certified by the manufacturer to provide those services.” We are making this change because there are currently no formal standardized programs or processes through which all manufacturers certify third-party vendors. We are also further clarifying that healthcare facilities which hire contractors to perform device reprocessing should verify that the contractor has an appropriate training program (i.e., consistent with what would be required in the healthcare facility) and that the training program includes the specific devices used by the healthcare facility.
Background
Recent media reports describe instances of patients being notified that they may be at increased risk for infection due to lapses in basic cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization of medical devices. These events involved failures to follow manufacturers’ reprocessing instructions for critical 
 and semi-critical 
 items and highlight the need for healthcare facilities to review policies and procedures that protect patients.
Recommendations
Healthcare facilities should arrange for a healthcare professional with expertise in device reprocessing to immediately assess their reprocessing procedures. This assessment should ensure that reprocessing is done correctly, including allowing enough time for reprocessing personnel to follow all steps recommended by the device manufacturer. The following actions should be performed:
Training
Healthcare facilities should provide training to all personnel who reprocess medical devices.

Training should be required and provided:

Upon hire or prior to provision of services at the facility
At least once a year
When new devices or protocols are introduced, including changes in the manufacturer’s instructions for use during the device’s life cycle
Personnel should be required to demonstrate competency with device reprocessing (i.e., trainer observes correct technique) prior to being allowed to perform reprocessing independently.
Healthcare facilities should maintain current documentation of trainings and competencies.
If the healthcare facility hires a contractor for device reprocessing, the facility should verify that the contractor has an appropriate training program (i.e., consistent with what would be required in the healthcare facility) and that the training program includes the specific devices the healthcare facility uses.
Copies of manufacturers’ instructions for operating and reprocessing each type of reusable device should be readily available to staff and inspectors. This file should include instructions for use of chemical disinfectants.
Audit and Feedback
Healthcare facilities should regularly audit (monitor and document) adherence to cleaning, disinfection, sterilization, and device storage procedures. Audits should assess all reprocessing steps, including:

Performing prompt cleaning after use, prior to disinfection or sterilization procedures
Using disinfectants in accordance with manufacturers’ instructions (e.g., dilution, contact time, storage, shelf-life)
Monitoring sterilizer performance (e.g., use of chemical and biological indicators, read-outs of sterilizer cycle parameters, appropriate record keeping)
Monitoring automated endoscope reprocessor performance (e.g., print out of flow rate, time, and temperature, use of chemical indicators for monitoring high-level disinfectant concentration)
Audits should be conducted in all areas of the facility where reprocessing occurs.
Healthcare facilities should provide feedback from audits to personnel regarding their adherence to cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization procedures.
Infection Control Policies and Procedures
Healthcare facilities should allow adequate time for reprocessing to ensure adherence to all steps recommended by the device manufacturer, including drying, proper storage, and transport of reprocessed devices.

Considerations should be made regarding scheduling of procedures and supply of devices to ensure adequate time is allotted for reprocessing.
Healthcare facilities should have protocols to ensure that healthcare personnel can readily identify devices that have been properly reprocessed and are ready for patient use (e.g., tagging system, storage in a designated area).
Healthcare facilities should have policies and procedures outlining facility response in the event of a recognized reprocessing error or failure. Healthcare personnel should assess the cause of the error or failure and the exposure event in order to determine the potential risk of infection. The procedure should include how patients who might have been exposed to an improperly reprocessed medical device would be identified, notified, and followed.
Individuals responsible for infection prevention and reprocessing at the healthcare facility should be consulted whenever new devices will be purchased or introduced to ensure that infection control considerations are included in the purchasing decision as well as subsequent implementation of appropriate reprocessing policies and procedures and to ensure that the recommended reprocessing equipment is available at the healthcare facility.
Healthcare facilities should maintain documentation of reprocessing activities, including maintenance records for reprocessing equipment (e.g., autoclaves, automated endoscope reprocessors, medical washers and washer-disinfectors, water treatment systems), sterilization records (physical, chemical, and biological indicator results), and records verifying high-level disinfectants were tested and replaced appropriately.
Healthcare facilities should follow manufacturer recommendations for maintenance and repair of medical devices that are used to perform reprocessing functions as well as medical devices that are reprocessed.",[]

Summary
CDC recommends that healthcare providers consider not only Ebola virus disease (EVD), but also other much more likely infectious diseases, including malaria, when evaluating ill travelers from Liberia to the United States. Signs and symptoms of EVD are non-specific and overlap with many other more prevalent infectious diseases in West Africa. For any patient returning from West Africa and presenting with non-specific signs and symptoms consistent with EVD, providers should use clinical judgment, taking into account the patient’s epidemiological history for management, diagnostic testing, and treatment and coordinate healthcare as needed with the state or local health department to ensure that these patients get appropriate care without delay. The rapid identification of the cause of an acute illness in a Person Under Investigation (PUI) enables rapid treatment and resolution of symptoms.  
Background
Travelers from Liberia are at extremely low risk of exposure to Ebola virus at this time. For more than two months, there have been no cases of Ebola virus disease in Liberia. On May 9, 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the end of the EVD outbreak in Liberia after 42 days (two incubation periods) had passed since the last EVD patient was buried. It has been more than three months since the last case in the border regions between Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea.
CDC changed the country classification for Liberia on May 13, 2015, to a country with former widespread Ebola virus transmission and current, established control measures. CDC and other international partners continue to support Liberia and neighboring countries in protecting their borders through training and technical assistance. Border officials in Liberia are trained to screen and identify persons with symptoms consistent with EVD and to act quickly and safely to prevent further movement or transmission, including isolating sick travelers and linking them to care. Public health officials in border communities are trained to coordinate contact investigations with counterparts across the border.  
Liberia now has a stronger surveillance and response system in place for suspected EVD cases, and the country remains vigilant in its efforts to stay at zero cases of EVD. Liberia is prepared to handle future EVD cases, should they arise, through:
Effective surveillance
Integrated laboratory testing capacity
Sustained capacity to rapidly triage, isolate, treat, and manage suspect EVD cases
Cross-border communication, screening, investigation, and information sharing
Active and on-going dead body swabbing
A prevention program to reduce the potential risk of sexual transmission of Ebola virus from survivors to susceptible partners
Recommendations
As of May 13, 2015, patients who have only traveled to Liberia in the previous 21 days are in the low (but not zero) risk category for EVD, and should be evaluated for the possibility of other illnesses, based on a complete travel, exposure and health history. The signs and symptoms of Ebola virus disease are non-specific, both in the early and advanced clinical course. Because EVD is very unlikely, especially in persons without direct contact with the blood or body fluids of a symptomatic EVD patient or direct contact with the body of a person who died of EVD, other more common conditions should be considered.
Because no cases of EVD among travelers with low (but not zero) risk of exposure who have been in a country with former widespread transmission in the previous 21 days have been documented, other more common acute conditions consistent with the signs and symptoms should be considered and placed higher on the list of differential diagnoses, as appropriate, and diagnostic testing conducted to confirm the diagnosis.   
Travelers with low (but not zero) risk of Ebola virus exposure returning to the United States from Ebola affected countries over the past year, who had symptoms suggestive of Ebola, most often had malaria or respiratory infections.
Common acute syndromes for which PUIs have presented for evaluation have included the following:
1. 
Acute febrile illnesses without localizing signs or symptoms
. These can be manifested with or without localizing signs by acute fever (definition ≥ 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit for PUIs), constantly elevated temperature or intermittent fever, subjective fever, and chills. Because the causes of fever among PUIs can be systemic, bacterial, viral, or parasitic, appropriate tests for these causes should be used to establish an alternative diagnosis. 
2. 
Acute upper and lower tract respiratory illnesses
. These can be manifested with or without fever by sneezing, nasal congestion or stuffiness, nasal discharge, sore throat, hoarseness, eye burning or tearing, cough, malaise, muscle aches, and headache. Because the causes of the common cold, sinusitis, pharyngitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia can be bacterial or viral, appropriate tests for these conditions should be used to establish an alternative diagnosis. 
3. 
Acute gastrointestinal (GI) illnesses
. These can be manifested with or without fever by diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, abdominal cramps, headaches, and rash. Because the causes of acute GI illness are likely to be due to enteric pathogens, hydration and empiric treatment should be considered, taking into account travel-associated etiologies. GI symptoms may also be associated with respiratory or systemic infections.  
Rapid tests for malaria, influenza, respiratory, and gastrointestinal pathogens are helpful. Proper interpretation of test results is needed as these rapid tests may not have the sensitivity or specificity necessary to rule out a pathogen. Molecular assays have much higher sensitivity than rapid screening tests.
For travelers from Liberia, with signs and symptoms consistent with EVD, healthcare providers should:
Place the patient in a private room with a private bathroom if he or she presents with signs and symptoms consistent with EVD; patient can be removed from isolation after the risk assessment is conducted and EVD is determined not to be the differential diagnosis
Follow routine standard hospital infection control practices/protocols based on symptom presentation
Conduct a thorough travel, Ebola virus exposure, and health history, including vaccination and prophylaxis compliance for other infectious diseases; diagnostic testing and treatment should be based on clinical judgment, taking into account  the patient’s EVD risk assessment
Evaluate the patient using clinical guidance and case definitions provided by CDC
Follow routine standard hospital infection control practices/protocols for use of patient care and other medical equipment, medical procedures, environmental infection control, and laboratory testing
Investigate other potential causes of the patient’s signs and symptoms without delay in patient care
For any patient returning from West Africa and presenting with non-specific signs and symptoms consistent with EVD, providers should use clinical judgment, taking into account the patient’s epidemiological history for management, diagnostic testing, and treatment. The rapid identification of the cause of an acute illness in a PUI enables rapid treatment and resolution of symptoms. 
Note about Lassa fever:
 
Healthcare providers may be concerned about a recent report of Lassa Fever, another viral hemorrhagic fever illness, in the US. However, Lassa fever is much less likely to be fatal than EVD, and there has never been person-to-person transmission of Lassa fever documented in the United States. Although Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever, the disease is different from EVD, which is responsible for the current outbreak in West Africa.  Lassa fever has an estimated 1 percent death rate while that for EVD has been as high as 70 percent.",[]

Summary
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to work with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other partners to closely monitor Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) globally, including the cases of MERS-CoV infection recently reported by China and the Republic of Korea, to better understand the risks to public health. The purpose of this HAN Advisory is to provide updated guidance to state health departments and healthcare providers in the evaluation of patients for MERS-CoV infection, which have been revised in light of the current situation in the Republic of Korea. Healthcare providers and public health officials should maintain awareness of the need to consider MERS-CoV infection in ill persons who have recently traveled from countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula
1
 
or in the Republic of Korea as outlined in the guidance below. Please disseminate this information to healthcare providers, especially infectious diseases specialists, intensive care physicians, internists, infection preventionists, and to emergency departments and microbiology laboratories.
Background
On May 20, 2015, the Republic of Korea (Korea) reported to WHO a case of laboratory-confirmed
2
 MERS-CoV infection, the first case in what is now the largest outbreak of MERS-CoV outside of the Arabian Peninsula
1
. The index case is a 68 year-old male who travelled to Bahrain, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), and Qatar, prior to returning to Korea on May 4. He subsequently became ill and sought medical care at several healthcare facilities before being diagnosed with MERS-CoV on May 20. Since then, as of June 10, 107 additional laboratory-confirmed
2
 cases of MERS-CoV have been identified according to the Republic of Korea Ministry of Health, for a total of 108 cases, including 9 deaths; WHO has confirmed 64 of these cases and 5 deaths. One of these cases is a contact associated with this outbreak who travelled from Korea to China on May 26 while symptomatic, tested positive for MERS-CoV in China on May 29, and is the first reported case from China; no other countries have reported any cases of MERS-CoV infection linked to this outbreak. According to available WHO reports, all reported cases are epidemiologically linked to the index case, with transmission limited to other patients, healthcare workers, and visitors in healthcare facilities where case-patients received care. This outbreak is still under investigation, and active contact tracing and prevention measures are ongoing in Korea and China. CDC is closely monitoring the situation to better understand the public health risks associated with this outbreak.
First identified and reported to cause severe acute respiratory illness in September 2012, MERS-CoV has caused infections worldwide, with 25 countries reporting cases to date. As of June 10, 2015, 1,219 laboratory-confirmed
2
 cases of MERS-CoV infection have been reported to and confirmed by WHO, including at least 449 (37%) deaths. The majority of cases (~85%) have been reported from KSA. All reported cases have been directly or indirectly linked through travel or residence to nine countries: KSA, UAE, Qatar, Jordan, Oman, Kuwait, Yemen, Lebanon, and Iran. In the United States (US), nationwide surveillance for MERS-CoV has been ongoing since 2012, and as of June 5, 2015, 45 states have submitted specimens to CDC or conducted their own testing for MERS-CoV based on CDC criteria available in their current form at 
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/case-def.html
. Of the 584 total persons tested in the US, two patients tested positive for MERS-CoV in May 2014 and were determined to be imported cases from KSA; the remaining 582 patients tested negative.
Recommendations
CDC continues to recommend that healthcare providers and health departments throughout the US be prepared to detect and manage cases of MERS. Healthcare providers should continue to routinely ask their patients about their travel history and healthcare facility exposure and to consider a diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection in persons who meet the criteria for patient under investigation (PUI), which has been revised to include considerations of recently being in a Korean healthcare facility and is available at 
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/case-def.html
. Specifically, persons who meet the following updated criteria for PUI should be evaluated for MERS-CoV infection in addition to other common respiratory pathogens
3
 and reported immediately to state and local health departments:
Fever AND pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (based on clinical or radiologic evidence) AND one of the following:

A history of travel from countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula
1
 within 14 days before symptom onset, OR close contact
4
 with a symptomatic traveler who developed fever and acute respiratory illness (not necessarily pneumonia) within 14 days after traveling from countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula
1
, OR
A history of being in a healthcare facility (as a patient, worker, or visitor) in the Republic of Korea within 14 days before symptom onset, OR
A member of a cluster of patients with severe acute respiratory illness (e.g., fever and pneumonia requiring hospitalization) of unknown etiology in which MERS-CoV is being evaluated, in consultation with state and local health departments in the US,
OR
Fever AND symptoms of respiratory illness (not necessarily pneumonia; e.g., cough, shortness of breath) AND a history of being in a healthcare facility (as a patient, worker, or visitor) within 14 days before symptom onset in a country or territory in or near the Arabian Peninsula
1
 in which recent healthcare-associated cases of MERS have been identified,
OR
Fever OR symptoms of respiratory illness (not necessarily pneumonia; e.g., cough, shortness of breath) AND close contact
4
 with a confirmed MERS case while the case was ill.
The above criteria serve as guidance for testing; however, patients should be evaluated and discussed with public health departments on a case-by-case basis if their clinical presentation or exposure history is equivocal (e.g., uncertain history of health care exposure).
Health departments should immediately report PUIs to CDC using the MERS PUI short form available at 
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/interim-guidance.html
, and should send completed investigation short forms by fax to CDC at 770-488-7107, or attach the short form to an email and send to 
eocreport@cdc.gov
 with the subject line: MERS Patient Form.
Recommendations may be updated as additional data become available. Guidance on the evaluation of patients for MERS-CoV infection, clinical specimen collection and testing, infection control, and home care and isolation measures is available on the CDC MERS website at 
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/index.html
Healthcare providers should adhere to recommended infection control measures, including standard, contact, and airborne precautions while managing patients in healthcare settings who are PUIs or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. Updated guidance on MERS-CoV infection control in healthcare settings is available at 
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/infection-prevention-control.html
For PUIs, CDC recommends collecting multiple specimens from different sites after symptom onset for testing with the CDC MERS-CoV rRT-PCR assay, including a lower respiratory specimen (e.g., sputum, broncheoalveolar lavage fluid, or tracheal aspirate), a nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab, and serum. Additional guidance for collection, handling, and testing of clinical specimens is available at 
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/guidelines-clinical-specimens.html
CDC interim guidance to prevent MERS-CoV from spreading in homes and communities in the US is available at 
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/hcp/home-care.html
No vaccine or specific treatment for MERS-CoV infection is available; care is supportive. WHO has posted guidance for clinical management of MERS patients at

Legionella pneumophila
4
 Close contact is defined as: a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) or within the room or care area for a prolonged period of time (e.g., healthcare personnel, household members) while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment (i.e., gowns, gloves, respirator, eye protection–see 
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/infection-prevention-control.html
); or b) having direct contact with infectious secretions (e.g., being coughed on) while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment (i.e., gowns, gloves, respirator, eye protection–see 
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/infection-prevention-control.html
). Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited. At this time, brief interactions, such as walking by a person, are considered low risk and do not constitute close contact.","['https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/case-def.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/case-def.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/interim-guidance.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/infection-prevention-control.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/guidelines-clinical-specimens.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/hcp/home-care.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/infection-prevention-control.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/infection-prevention-control.html']"

Summary
CDC continues to receive new reports of infections with Shigella strains that are not susceptible to ciprofloxacin and/or azithromycin, the antimicrobial agents most commonly used to treat shigellosis. Most cases have been reported among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (collectively referred to as MSM) in Illinois, Minnesota, and Montana and among international travelers, but cases are also occurring among other populations. Shigellosis is very contagious and can spread quickly through communities and across different segments of the population.
CDC recommends meticulous handwashing and other hygiene practices to prevent shigellosis and encourages patients with symptoms of shigellosis such as diarrhea and fever to visit a healthcare provider. Clinicians should obtain stool cultures from patients suspected of having shigellosis, counsel patients about shigellosis prevention, and, when treatment is required, select drugs based on antimicrobial susceptibility test results.
This Health Alert Network (HAN) Advisory provides the following:
Information about the current status of the outbreaks;
Recommendations for clinical management, counseling, and follow-up of exposed patients and their contacts;
Recommendations on general prevention methods for the public, childcare centers, MSM, and international travelers;
Information about testing and interpretation of azithromycin susceptibility among shigellae; and
Information about revisions to CDC’s Shigella website on shigellosis prevention among MSM.

Summary
The Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are investigating a large outbreak of recent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections among persons who inject drugs (PWID). Many of the HIV-infected individuals in this outbreak are co-infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). The purpose of this HAN Advisory is to alert public health departments and healthcare providers of the possibility of HIV outbreaks among PWID and to provide guidance to assist in the identification and prevention of such outbreaks.
Background
From November 2014 to January 2015, ISDH identified 11 new HIV infections in a rural southeastern county where fewer than 5 infections have been identified annually in the past. As of April 21, 2015, an on-going investigation by ISDH with assistance from CDC has identified 135 persons with newly diagnosed HIV infections in a community of 4,200 people; 84% were also HCV infected. Among 112 persons interviewed thus far, 108 (96%) injected drugs; all reported dissolving and injecting tablets of the prescription-type opioid oxymorphone (OPANA® ER) using shared drug preparation and injection equipment.
1
This HIV outbreak was first recognized by a local disease intervention specialist. In late 2014, interviews conducted with three persons newly diagnosed with HIV infections in three separate venues (i.e., an outpatient clinic, a drug rehabilitation program, during a hospitalization) indicated that two of these persons had recently injected drugs and had numerous syringe-sharing and sexual partners. Contact tracing identified eight additional HIV infections leading to the current outbreak investigation, which has demonstrated that HIV had spread recently and rapidly through the local network of PWID. Without an attentive health department, active case finding, and additional testing provided as part of this investigation, this cluster may not have been identified.
Urgent action is needed to prevent further HIV and HCV transmission in this area and to investigate and control any similar outbreaks in other communities.
Injection drug use accounts for an estimated 8%
2
 
of the approximate 50,000 annual new HIV infections in the United States.
3
 
HCV infection is the most common blood-borne infection in the United States and percutaneous exposure via drug-injecting equipment contaminated with HCV-infected blood is the most frequent mode of transmission. Nationally, acute HCV infections have increased 150% from 2010 to 2013,
4
 and over 70% of long-term PWID may be infected with HCV.
5
 Abuse of prescription-type opioids is increasing nationally
6
 and opioid-analgesic poisoning deaths have nearly quadrupled from 1999 through 2011.
7
 Rates of acute HCV infection are increasing, especially among young nonurban PWID, often in association with abuse of injected prescription-type opioids. These increases have been most substantial in nonurban counties east of the Mississippi River.
8
Recommendations for Health Departments
Review the most recent sources of data on HIV diagnoses, HCV diagnoses (acute as well as past or present), overdose deaths, admissions for drug treatment, and drug arrests. Attributes of communities at risk for unrecognized clusters of HIV and HCV infection include the following:

Recent increases in the:

Number of HIV infections attributed to injection drug use,
Number of HCV infections, particularly among persons aged 
 35 years;
High rates of injection drug use and especially prescription-type opioid abuse, drug-related overdose, drug treatment admission, or drug arrests.
Ensure complete contact tracing for all new HIV diagnoses and testing of all contacts for HIV and HCV infection.
Ensure persons actively injecting drugs or at high-risk of drug injection (e.g., participating in drug substitution programs, receiving substance abuse counseling or treatment, recently or currently incarcerated) have access to integrated prevention services,
9
 and specifically:

Are tested regularly for HIV and HCV infection (consider more frequent testing based on frequency of injection drug usage or sharing of injection equipment);
If diagnosed with HIV or HCV infection:

Are rapidly linked to care and treatment services;
If actively injecting drugs:

Have access to medication-assisted therapy (e.g., opioid substitution therapy) as well as other substance abuse services, if not already engaged,
Are counseled not to share needles and syringes or drug preparation equipment (e.g., cookers, water, filters),
Have access to sterile injection equipment from a reliable source.
If not HIV infected but actively injecting drugs:

Are referred for consideration of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis
10
 and if potentially exposed within the past 72 hours (e.g., shared drug preparation or injection equipment with a known or potentially HIV-infected person) HIV post-exposure prophylaxis
11
12
Remind venues that may encounter unrecognized infections, such as emergency departments and community-based clinical practices (e.g., family medicine, general medicine, prenatal care) of the importance of routine opt-out HIV testing as well as HCV testing per current recommendations
13-15
Local health departments should notify their state health department and CDC of any suspected clusters of recent HIV or HCV infection.
Recommendations for Healthcare Providers
Ensure all persons diagnosed with HCV infection are tested for HIV infection,
16
 and that all persons diagnosed with HIV infection are tested for HCV infection.
17
Ensure persons receiving treatment for HIV and/or HCV infection adhere to prescribed therapy and are engaged in ongoing care.
Encourage HIV and HCV testing of syringe-sharing and sexual partners of persons diagnosed with either infection.
Report all newly diagnosed HIV and HCV infections to the health department.
For all persons with substance abuse problems:

Refer them for medication-assisted treatment (e.g., opioid substitution therapy) and counseling services,
Use effective treatments (e.g., methadone, buprenorphine), as appropriately indicated.
For any persons for whom opioids are under consideration for pain management:

Discuss the risks and benefits of all pain treatment options, including ones that do not involve prescription analgesics.
Note that long-term opioid therapy has not been demonstrated to reduce chronic pain.
18
Contact the state or local health department to report suspected clusters of recent HIV or HCV infection.","['https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5514a1.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5402a1.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5514a1.htm']"

Summary
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and State Health Departments are investigating a multi-state outbreak of measles associated with travel to Disneyland Resort Theme Parks (which includes Disneyland and Disney California Adventure). The purpose of this HAN Advisory is to notify public health departments and healthcare facilities about this measles outbreak and to provide guidance to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers should ensure that all of their patients are current on MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine. They should consider measles in the differential diagnosis of patients with fever and rash and ask patients about recent international travel or travel to domestic venues frequented by international travelers. They should also ask patients about their history of measles exposures in their community. Please disseminate this information to healthcare providers in hospitals and emergency rooms, to primary care providers, and to microbiology laboratories.
Background
Measles is a highly contagious, acute viral illness. It begins with a prodrome of fever, cough, coryza (runny nose), conjunctivitis (pink eye), lasting 2-4 days prior to rash onset. Measles can cause severe health complications, including pneumonia, encephalitis, and death. Measles is transmitted by contact with an infected person through coughing and sneezing; infected people are contagious from 4 days before their rash starts through 4 days afterwards. After an infected person leaves a location, the virus remains viable for up to 2 hours on surfaces and in the air.
The United States is experiencing a large multi-state measles outbreak that started in California in December 2014 and has spread to six additional states and Mexico. The initial confirmed case-patients reported visiting Disneyland Resort Theme Parks in Orange County, CA, from December 17 through December 20, 2014. From December 28, 2014, through January 21, 2015, 51 confirmed cases of measles linked to this outbreak have been reported to CDC, 42 from California and 9 from six other states (3 in UT, 2 in WA, 1 in OR, 1 in CO, 1 in NE, and 1 in AZ). In addition to the U.S. cases, one case was reported from Mexico in an unvaccinated child who visited Disneyland Resort Theme Parks on December 17 and December 20, 2014. At this time, no source case for the outbreak has been identified, but it is likely that a traveler (or more than one traveler) who was infected with measles overseas visited one or both of the Disney parks in December during their infectious period.
For cases with age reported, the age of case-patients range from 10 months to 57 years (median = 16.5 years). To date, 8 (15%) case-patients were hospitalized. Of the 52 outbreak-associated cases, 28 (55%) were unvaccinated, 17 (31%) had unknown vaccination status, and 6 (12%) were vaccinated. Of the 6 cases vaccinated, 2 had received 1 dose and 4 had received 2 or more doses. Among the 28 unvaccinated cases, 5 were under age for vaccination. Measles genotype information was available from 9 measles cases; all were genotype B3 and all sequences linked to this outbreak are identical. The sequences are also identical to the genotype B3 virus that caused a large outbreak in the Philippines in 2014. During the last 6 months, identical genotype B3 viruses were also detected in at least 14 countries and at least 6 U.S. states, not including those linked to the current outbreak.
Measles was declared eliminated (i.e., interruption of year-round endemic transmission) in the United States in 2000, because of high population immunity achieved by high 2-dose measles vaccine coverage and a highly effective measles vaccine. However, measles is still endemic in many parts of the world, and outbreaks can occur in the U.S. when unvaccinated groups are exposed to imported measles virus. In 2014, nearly half of importations in the U.S. were linked to travel to the Philippines during the large measles outbreak in that country. Disney and other theme parks are international attractions, and visitors come from many parts of the world, including locations where measles is endemic. The current multi-state outbreak underscores the ongoing risk of importation of measles, the need for high measles vaccine coverage, and the importance of a prompt and appropriate public health response to measles cases and outbreaks.
Because of the success of the measles vaccine program, most young physicians have never seen a case of measles and may not take a detailed history of travel or potential exposure and initially may not consider the diagnosis in a clinically compatible case.
Recommendations for Health Care Providers
Ensure all patients are up to date on MMR vaccine* and other vaccines.
For those who travel abroad, CDC recommends that all U.S. residents older than 6 months be protected from measles and receive MMR vaccine, if needed, prior to departure.

Infants 6 through 11 months old should receive 1 dose of MMR vaccine before departure.†
Children 12 months of age or older should have documentation of 2 doses of MMR vaccine (separated by at least 28 days).
Teenagers and adults without evidence of measles immunity** should have documentation of 2 appropriately spaced doses of MMR vaccine.
Consider measles as a diagnosis in anyone with a febrile rash illness and clinically compatible symptoms (cough, coryza, and/or conjunctivitis) who has recently traveled abroad or who has had contact with someone with a febrile rash illness. Immunocompromised patients may not exhibit rash or may exhibit an atypical rash. The incubation period for measles from exposure to fever is usually about 10 days (range, 7 to 12 days) and from exposure to rash onset is usually 14 days (range, 7 to 21 days).
Isolate suspect measles case-patients and immediately report cases to local health departments to ensure a prompt public health response.
Obtain specimens for testing, including viral specimens for confirmation and genotyping.  Contact the local health department for assistance with submitting specimens for testing.
* Children 1 through 12 years of age may receive MMRV vaccine for protection against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella.
† Infants who receive a dose of MMR vaccine before their first birthday should receive 2 more doses of MMR vaccine, the first of which should be administered when the child is 12 through 15 months of age and the second at least 28 days later.
** One of the following is considered evidence of measles immunity for international travelers: 1) birth before 1957, 2) documented administration of 2 doses of live measles virus vaccine (MMR, MMRV, 
or
 measles vaccines), 3) laboratory (serologic) proof of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease.","['https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6322a4.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccination.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6350a9.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6204a1.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt07-measles.html']"

As a follow-up to
 
HAN 00374
 
(Dec. 3, 2014), CDC is providing 1) a summary of influenza antiviral drug treatment recommendations, 2) an update about approved treatment drugs and supply this season, and 3) background information for patients regarding anti-influenza treatment.
Summary
Widespread influenza activity is being reported in most U.S. states, with influenza A (H3N2) viruses most common. H3N2-predominant flu seasons have been associated with more hospitalizations and deaths in older people and young children in the past. In addition, approximately two-thirds of H3N2 viruses that have been tested at CDC are antigenically or genetically different from the H3N2 vaccine virus. This difference suggests that vaccine effectiveness may be reduced this season. High hospitalization rates are being observed, similar to what was seen during the 2012-2013 influenza season. Hospitalization rates are especially high among people 65 years and older. In this context, the use of influenza antiviral drugs as an adjunct to vaccination becomes even more important than usual in protecting people from influenza. Antiviral medications are effective in treating influenza and reducing complications. Antivirals are available and recommended, but evidence from the current and previous influenza seasons suggests that they are severely underutilized.
This CDC Health Update is being issued
to remind clinicians that influenza should be high on their list of possible diagnoses for ill patients, because influenza activity is elevated nationwide, and
to advise clinicians that all hospitalized patients and all high-risk patients (either hospitalized or outpatient) with suspected influenza should be treated as soon as possible with one of three available influenza antiviral medications. This should be done 
without
 waiting for confirmatory influenza testing. While antiviral drugs work best when given early, therapeutic benefit has been observed even when treatment is initiated later.
CDC Antiviral Recommendations for the 2014-2015 Season
CDC recommends antiviral medications for treatment of influenza as an important adjunct to annual influenza vaccination. Treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors has been shown to have clinical and public health benefit in reducing illness and severe outcomes of influenza, as evidenced from randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials, and observational studies of oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, or parenteral peramivir treatment during past influenza seasons and during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.
All Hospitalized, Severely Ill, and High Risk Patients with Suspected Influenza Should Be Treated with Antivirals
Any patient with suspected or confirmed influenza in the following categories should be treated with a neuraminidase inhibitor:
Is hospitalized – treatment is recommended for all hospitalized patients
Has severe, complicated, or progressive illness – this may include outpatients with severe or prolonged progressive symptoms or who develop complications such as pneumonia
Is at higher risk for influenza complications (hospitalized or outpatient) – patients in this group include:

children younger than 2 years (although all children younger than 5 years are considered at higher risk for complications from influenza, the highest risk is for those younger than 2 years);
adults aged 65 years and older;
persons with chronic pulmonary (including asthma), cardiovascular (except hypertension alone), renal, hepatic, hematological (including sickle cell disease), and metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus), or neurologic and neurodevelopment conditions (including disorders of the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerve, and muscle such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy [seizure disorders], stroke, intellectual disability [mental retardation], moderate to severe developmental delay, muscular dystrophy, or spinal cord injury);
persons with immunosuppression, including that caused by medications or by HIV infection;
women who are pregnant or postpartum (within 2 weeks after delivery);
persons aged younger than 19 years who are receiving long-term aspirin therapy;
American Indians/Alaska Natives;
persons who are morbidly obese (i.e., body-mass index is equal to or greater than 40); and
residents of nursing homes and other chronic-care facilities.
Timing of Treatment and Implications for Patient Evaluation, Treatment and Testing
Clinical benefit is greatest when antiviral treatment is administered early in the illness course. When indicated, antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible after illness onset and 
should not be delayed
 even for a few hours to wait for the results of testing. Ideally, treatment should be initiated within 48 hours of symptom onset. 
However, antiviral treatment initiated later than 48 hours after illness onset can still be beneficial for some patients.
 Observational studies of hospitalized patients suggest that while the greatest benefit occurs when antiviral treatment is initiated within 48 hours of illness onset, treatment might still be beneficial when initiated up to 4 or 5 days after symptom onset. Also, a randomized placebo controlled study suggested clinical benefit when oseltamivir was initiated 72 hours after illness onset among febrile children with uncomplicated influenza. Clinical judgment, on the basis of the patient’s disease severity and progression, age, underlying medical conditions, likelihood of influenza, and time since onset of symptoms, is important when making antiviral treatment decisions for outpatients.
Because of the importance of early treatment, 
decisions about starting antiviral treatment
 
should not wait for laboratory confirmation of influenza
. Therefore, treatment should generally be initiated empirically. During influenza season especially, health care providers should advise high risk patients to call their provider promptly if they have symptoms of influenza. It may be useful for providers to implement phone triage lines to enable high risk patients to discuss symptoms over the phone. To facilitate early initiation of treatment, when feasible, an antiviral prescription can be provided without testing and before an office visit.
The results of rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs; immunoassays that can identify the presence of influenza A and B viral nucleoprotein antigens in respiratory specimens) may not be accurate; test sensitivities are approximately 50-70% when compared with viral culture or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). 
Clinicians should realize that a negative RIDT result does not exclude a diagnosis of influenza in a patient with suspected influenza.
 Other factors such as the quality of the specimen and timing of specimen collection may also affect test results. Rapid molecular assays are a new type of molecular influenza diagnostic test (
https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/molecular-assays.htm
). Molecular testing is not needed for all patients with suspected influenza, but is most appropriate for hospitalized patients if a test result would lead to a change in clinical management.
Antivirals in Non-High Risk Patients with Uncomplicated Influenza
Neuraminidase inhibitors can benefit other individuals with influenza. While current guidance focuses treatment on those with severe illness or at high risk of complications from influenza, antiviral treatment may be prescribed on the basis of clinical judgment for any previously healthy (non-high risk) outpatient with suspected or confirmed influenza. Neuraminidase inhibitors reduce the duration of symptoms by ~1 day in healthy persons with uncomplicated influenza.
For previously healthy, symptomatic outpatients, if treatment is given, it is recommended that treatment be initiated within 48 hours of illness onset, although it is possible that treatment started after 48 hours may offer some benefit.
Antiviral Medications
Three prescription neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral medications are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are recommended for use in the United States during the 2014-2015 influenza season: oseltamivir (Tamiflu®), zanamivir (Relenza®), and peramivir (Rapivab®).
Oral oseltamivir is FDA-approved for treatment of influenza in persons aged 2 weeks and older, and for chemoprophylaxis to prevent influenza in people 1 year of age and older. Although not part of the FDA-approved indications, use of oral oseltamivir for treatment of influenza in infants younger than 14 days old, and for chemoprophylaxis in infants 3 months to 1 year of age, is recommended by the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics. Due to limited data, use of oseltamivir for chemoprophylaxis is not recommended in children younger than 3 months unless the situation is judged critical.
Inhaled zanamivir is FDA-approved for treatment of persons 7 years and older and for prevention of influenza in persons 5 years and older.
Intravenous peramivir was approved on December 19, 2014, for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza in persons 18 years and older. An FDA press release related to this announcement is available at 
http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm427755.htm
External
Adamantanes (rimantadine and amantadine) are not currently recommended for treatment or prevention of influenza because of high levels of resistance among circulating influenza A viruses.
There are no current national shortages of neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir). However, local spot shortages have been reported for some formulations. Therefore, it may be necessary to contact more than one pharmacy to fill a prescription for an antiviral medication.
If there is difficulty locating commercial Tamiflu® for Oral Suspension, oral suspension can be compounded by a pharmacy from oseltamivir capsules. However, this compounded suspension should not be used for convenience or when the FDA-approved Tamiflu® for Oral Suspension is commercially available.
Please see information for health care professionals regarding compounding an oral suspension from oseltamivir 75 mg capsules at 
http://www.tamiflu.com/hcp/resources/hcp_resources_pharmacists.jsp

Additional Considerations for Clinicians
Antibiotics are not effective against influenza infection, and early diagnosis of influenza can reduce the inappropriate use of antibiotics. However, because certain bacterial infections can produce symptoms similar to influenza and bacterial infections can occur as a complication of influenza, bacterial infections should be considered and appropriately treated, if suspected. In addition, because pneumococcal infections are a serious complication of influenza infection, new pneumococcal vaccine recommendations for adults 65 years of age or older, as well as adults and children at increased risk for invasive pneumococcal disease due to chronic underlying medical conditions should be followed (see 
https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pneumo/vac-PCV13-adults.htm
 and 
https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pneumo/vacc-in-short.htm
 for further information).
The most common adverse events associated with oral oseltamivir include a slightly increased risk of nausea and vomiting over placebo, with nausea occurring in 10% of adults with influenza who received oseltamivir and 6% of people who received placebo in controlled clinical trials (3% and 4%, respectively, in children), and vomiting occurring in 9% of adults with influenza who received oseltamivir and 3% of people who received placebo in controlled clinical trials (15% and 9%, respectively, in children). These symptoms are generally transient and can be mitigated if oseltamivir is taken with food. Adverse events for inhaled zanamivir were not increased over placebo in clinical trials, but cases of bronchospasm have been reported during postmarketing; inhaled zanamivir is not recommended for persons with underlying airways disease (e.g., asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases). For people who received peramivir intravenously or intramuscularly in clinical trials, the most common adverse event was diarrhea, occurring in 8% versus 7% in people who received placebo.
Resources for Patient Education
Results from unpublished CDC qualitative research shows that most people interviewed were not aware that drugs to treat influenza illness are available. Patients being provided a prescription for an influenza antiviral drug may have questions. A fact sheet for patients is available at 
https://www.cdc.gov/flu/antivirals/whatyoushould.htm
Note the following important background information for patients:
If you get the flu, antiviral drugs are a treatment option.
It is very important that antiviral drugs are used early to treat hospitalized patients, people with severe flu illness, and people who are at high risk for flu complications because of their age, severity of illness, or underlying medical conditions.
If you have severe illness or are at high risk of serious flu complications, you may be treated with flu antiviral drugs if you get the flu.
For people with a high-risk condition, treatment with an antiviral drug can mean the difference between having milder illness instead of very serious illness that could result in a hospital stay.
Other people also may be treated with antiviral drugs by their doctor this season. Most otherwise-healthy people who get the flu, however, do not need to be treated with antiviral drugs.
Studies show that flu antiviral drugs work best for treatment when they are started within 2 days of getting sick. However, starting antivirals later can still be helpful for some people.
If your health care provider thinks you have the flu, your health care provider may prescribe antiviral drugs. A test for flu is not necessary.
Antibiotics are not effective against the flu. Using antibiotics inappropriately can lead to antibiotic resistance and may expose patients to unwanted side effects of the drug.
Other practices that may help decrease the spread of influenza include respiratory hygiene, cough etiquette, social distancing (e.g., staying home from work and school when ill, staying away from people who are sick) and hand washing.","['https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/molecular-assays.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pneumo/vac-PCV13-adults.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pneumo/vacc-in-short.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/flu/antivirals/whatyoushould.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/antivirals/summary-clinicians.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/molecular-assays.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/infectioncontrol/ltc-facility-guidance.htm']"

Summary
On November 28, 2016, the Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS) reported the first case of locally acquired mosquito-borne Zika virus infection in the city of Brownsville, Cameron County, Texas. On December 9, 2016, four additional cases in people living in proximity to the first case were reported. TDSHS continues to investigate Zika virus transmission in Brownsville.
Currently only five cases are known to have been locally acquired in the Brownsville area, and there is not yet any evidence of widespread, sustained local transmission. However, temperatures in the region are still conducive to mosquito-borne transmission, and therefore the risk of continued local transmission of Zika virus cannot be ruled out. CDC, TDSHS, and local authorities continue to investigate the cases in Brownsville and will share up-to-date information and recommendations as the situation develops. The active, ongoing surveillance and response underway in Texas will provide more information over time that may allow for more precise and focused assessment of risk. The exact level and location of risk of Zika virus infection in Brownsville is unknown; pregnant women in the area are at some risk for Zika virus infection.
For these reasons, CDC is designating the city of Brownsville as a Zika cautionary (yellow) area for testing and travel guidance, as recommended in the CDC Interim Zika Response Plan (
https://www.cdc.gov/zika/pdfs/zika-draft-interim-conus-plan.pdf
Cdc-pdf
 ). Based on the earliest time of symptom onset for cases of locally acquired Zika virus infection in Brownsville and a maximum 2-week incubation period for Zika virus, this guidance applies to pregnant women, women of reproductive age, and their sexual partners who live in or traveled to Brownsville on or after October 29, 2016. Because many people with Zika virus infection will not have symptoms or will have only mild symptoms, additional people may be infected.
Brownsville is located in Cameron County, Texas, which shares a border with Mexico (
https://www.cdc.gov/zika/intheus/texas-update.html
). Many people travel regularly across the United States-Mexico border to temporarily live, work, attend school, socialize, and seek medical care. Areas of active Zika virus transmission have also been reported in Mexico near the United States-Mexico border, and CDC issued a Travel Notice for Mexico (
https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/alert/zika-virus-mexico
) on December 10, 2015, recommending that pregnant women should not travel to any area of Mexico below 6,500 feet.
This is an ongoing investigation, and TDSHS, Cameron County Health Department, Brownsville Health Department, and CDC are working together to rapidly learn more about the extent of Zika virus transmission in Brownsville. CDC will update these recommendations as more information becomes available.
Recommendations for Brownsville, Texas (yellow area)
Travel Recommendations for Pregnant Women
Pregnant women who live in other areas should consider postponing travel to Brownsville. Areas of mosquito-borne transmission can arise and resolve over time. Travelers, and in particular, pregnant women, are urged to monitor the CDC website to ensure they have access to the most up-to-date information and recommendations (
https://www.cdc.gov/zika/
).
Prevention Recommendations for Pregnant Women
Pregnant women and their partners who live in or travel to Brownsville should be aware of local Zika virus transmission and should strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites. (
https://www.cdc.gov/zika/prevention/prevent-mosquito-bites.html
).
Pregnant women and their partners who live in or travel to Brownsville should consistently and correctly use condoms to prevent Zika virus infection during sex (vaginal, anal, or oral) or should not have sex during the pregnancy.
Testing Recommendations for Pregnant Women
Pregnant women with an epidemiologic link to Brownsville on or after October 29, 2016, should be tested for Zika virus infection in accordance with CDC guidance. An epidemiologic link means that they live in, traveled to, or had sex without using a condom with someone who lives in or traveled to Brownsville on or after this date (
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6529e1.htm?s_cid=mm6529e1_e
).

Pregnant women with symptoms of Zika virus disease should be tested according to CDC guidance, which is based on the time of evaluation relative to symptom onset.
Pregnant women with ongoing risks for exposure (who live in or frequently travel [for example, daily, weekly]) to Brownsville and who are without symptoms of Zika virus disease should consult with their healthcare provider to obtain testing for Zika virus infection in both the first and second trimesters of pregnancy.
Pregnant women who are asymptomatic but who have had limited risks for exposure (limited travel to or sex without using a condom with a partner who lives in or has traveled to Brownsville) should also be tested for Zika virus infection. Laboratory testing for these women should be performed based on the time of clinical evaluation relative to last possible exposure in accordance with CDC guidance (
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6529e1.htm
).
Healthcare providers should contact their state, local, or territorial health department to coordinate testing and interpret results. Healthcare providers should discuss the limitations of laboratory tests used to diagnose Zika virus infection with pregnant women and their partners, including the possibility of false positive results related to prior exposure to other flaviviruses (for example, dengue).
Women and Their Partners Who are Planning to Conceive in the Near Future
Women who have limited risk (limited travel to or sex without using a condom with a partner who lives in or has traveled to Brownsville) of possible exposure may consider waiting at least 8 weeks from symptom onset (if symptomatic) or last possible exposure (if asymptomatic) to attempt conception.
Men who have limited risk (limited travel to or sex without using a condom with a partner who lives in or has traveled to Brownsville) of possible exposure may consider waiting at least 6 months from symptom onset (if symptomatic) or last possible exposure (if asymptomatic) to attempt conception.
People living in Brownsville should be counseled on the possible risk for Zika virus infection during the periconceptional period. Women and men should discuss their reproductive life plans with their healthcare provider in the context of potential and ongoing Zika virus exposure. Women and men with ongoing risks for exposure and who are diagnosed with Zika virus disease should wait at least 8 weeks and at least 6 months, respectively, after symptom onset before attempting conception.
Some couples in which one or both partners have had a possible Zika virus exposure might choose to wait longer or shorter than the recommended period to conceive, depending on individual circumstances (for example, age, fertility, details of possible exposure) and risk tolerance. Limited data exist on the persistence of Zika virus RNA in body fluids, and the risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with maternal Zika virus infection around the time of conception is currently not known.
Women and their partners who are attempting conception and live in or travel to Brownsville should be aware of Zika virus transmission and should strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites. (
https://www.cdc.gov/zika/prevention/prevent-mosquito-bites.html
).
Background
Zika virus is spread to people primarily through the bite of an infected 
Aedes 
species mosquito (
Ae. aegypti
 and 
Ae. albopictus
). Zika virus can also be sexually transmitted. Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of microcephaly and severe fetal brain defects and has been associated with other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Most people infected with Zika virus will not have symptoms; infants with microcephaly and other birth defects have been born to women with Zika virus infection who did not report symptoms.
For pregnant women who report clinical illness consistent with Zika virus disease (symptomatic pregnant women), CDC’s testing recommendations are the same for those with ongoing risk and those with limited risk for possible Zika virus exposure. Symptomatic pregnant women who are evaluated less than 2 weeks after symptom onset should receive serum and urine Zika virus RNA nucleic acid test (NAT) testing. Symptomatic pregnant women who are evaluated 2 to 12 weeks after symptom onset should first receive a Zika virus immunoglobulin (Ig) M antibody test; if the IgM antibody test result is positive or equivocal (unclear), serum and urine RNA NAT testing should be performed. If the RNA NAT result is negative, a positive or equivocal (unclear) Zika virus IgM antibody test result should be followed by plaque reduction neutralization testing (PRNT). Interpretation of serologic results has been described (
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6521e1.htm
).
Testing recommendations for pregnant women with possible Zika virus exposure who do not report clinical illness consistent with Zika virus disease (asymptomatic pregnant women) differ based on the circumstances of possible exposure. For asymptomatic pregnant women with ongoing risk for possible exposure who are evaluated less than 2 weeks after last possible exposure, RNA NAT testing should be performed. If the RNA NAT result is negative, a Zika virus IgM antibody test should be performed 2 to 12 weeks after the exposure. Asymptomatic pregnant women with limited risk for possible exposure who are first evaluated 2 to 12 weeks after their last possible exposure should first receive a Zika virus IgM antibody test; if the IgM antibody test result is positive or equivocal (unclear), serum and urine RNA NAT should be performed. Asymptomatic pregnant women with ongoing risk for possible exposure to Zika virus should receive Zika virus IgM antibody testing as part of routine obstetric care during the first and second trimesters; immediate RNA NAT testing should be performed when IgM antibody test results are positive or equivocal (unclear).
Further information on the interpretation of laboratory test results and clinical management of pregnant women with laboratory evidence of possible Zika virus infection are available below.","['https://www.cdc.gov/zika/intheus/texas-update.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/zika/prevention/prevent-mosquito-bites.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6529e1.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/zika/prevention/prevent-mosquito-bites.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6521e1.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/zika/hc-providers/pregnant-woman.html']"

Summary
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) previously issued travel, testing, and other guidance related to areas of active Zika virus transmission in Florida. Because local transmission of Zika virus continues to be reported in Miami-Dade County, CDC is strengthening travel recommendations for pregnant women to Miami-Dade County and also reinforcing recommendations for use of protective measures to prevent exposure to Zika. CDC is updating recommendations to emphasize testing for pregnant women with an epidemiologic link to Miami-Dade County. An epidemiologic link means that they lived in, traveled to, or had unprotected sex with someone who lived in or traveled to, the designated area. In addition, CDC has made specific recommendations for areas of identified active transmission. 
The Florida Department of Health (FL DOH) has identified a new area where local, state, and CDC officials have determined that the intensity of Zika virus transmission presents a significant risk to pregnant women in a designated one-square-mile area located in Miami-Dade County (NW 79th St. to the north, NW 63rd St. to the south, NW 10th Ave. to the west and N. Miami Ave. to the east). 
Pregnant women should consider postponing travel to all areas of Miami-Dade County. Pregnant women should specifically avoid travel to the previously identified 4.5-square-mile area of Miami Beach and one-square-mile area in Little River located in Miami-Dade County (
http//www.cdc.gov/zika/intheus/florida-update.html
). 
Pregnant women who have an epidemiologic link to any area of Miami-Dade County after August 1, 2016 should be tested for Zika virus in accordance with CDC guidance (
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6529e1.htm?s_cid=mm6529e1_e
).

Pregnant women with an epidemiologic link to the 4.5-square-mile area of Miami Beach with active Zika virus transmission, after July 14, 2016, should be tested for Zika virus.
Because the incubation period for Zika virus infection is up to two weeks and many people infected with Zika virus will not have symptoms or will only have mild symptoms, investigating cases may take several weeks. Data collected during the ongoing investigation indicate the period of time since August 1 represents the timeframe with the highest transmission in Miami-Dade County.
FL DOH and CDC continue to work together on this ongoing investigation to learn more about active Zika virus transmission in Miami-Dade County. CDC will update these recommendations as more information becomes available. Healthcare providers should visit CDC’s Zika website (
https://www.cdc.gov/zika/
) frequently for the most up-to-date recommendations.
Recommendations
Red and Yellow Area Designation
CDC has defined two types of geographic areas within the continental United States and Hawaii to implement measures to prevent Zika virus transmission: Zika active transmission areas (designated as red) and Zika cautionary areas (designated as yellow).
A 
red area 
is a geographic area where local, state, and CDC officials have determined that the intensity of Zika virus transmission presents a significant risk to pregnant women. The intensity of Zika virus transmission is determined by several factors including geographic distribution of cases, number of cases identified, known or suspected links between cases and population density.
A
 yellow area 
is a geographic area where local transmission has been identified, but evidence is lacking on whether the intensity of transmission is comparable to that in a red area. Although the level of risk in yellow areas is unknown, pregnant women are still at risk. Additionally, areas adjacent to or in proximity to red areas may have a greater likelihood of local transmission and, therefore, risk to pregnant women.
Currently, a 4.5-square-mile area of Miami Beach and one-square-mile area in Little River located in Miami-Dade County (
http//www.cdc.gov/zika/intheus/florida-update.html
) are red areas and the rest of Miami-Dade County is a yellow area. Because this investigation is ongoing and the designation of areas is likely to change over time, please frequently check the website (
http//www.cdc.gov/zika/intheus/florida-update.html
) for the most up-to-date designation of red and yellow areas.
Recommendations for Miami-Dade County 
Travel Recommendations for Pregnant Women
Pregnant women should consider postponing travel to yellow areas of Miami-Dade County. 
Pregnant women should specifically avoid travel to red areas (
http//www.cdc.gov/zika/intheus/florida-update.html
) because the intensity of Zika virus transmission confirmed in these areas presents a significant risk to pregnant women. 
Testing Recommendations for Pregnant Women
Pregnant women with an epidemiologic link to Miami-Dade County after August 1, 2016, should be tested for Zika virus infection in accordance with CDC guidance. Pregnant women with an epidemiologic link to the 4.5-square-mile area of Miami Beach with active Zika virus transmission after July 14, 2016, should be tested for Zika virus (
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6529e1.htm?s_cid=mm6529e1_e
).

Pregnant women with symptoms of Zika virus disease should be tested according to CDC guidance, which is based on the time of evaluation relative to symptom onset.
Pregnant women with ongoing exposure (who live in or frequently travel [e.g., daily, weekly]) to Miami-Dade County and who are without symptoms of Zika virus disease should consult with their healthcare provider to obtain testing for Zika virus infection in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy.
Pregnant women who have had limited travel to or had sex without using a condom with a partner who lives in or has traveled to Miami-Dade County should be tested for Zika virus infection. This testing should be performed based on the time of evaluation relative to last possible exposure in accordance with CDC guidance. 
Healthcare providers should contact their state, local, or territorial health department to coordinate testing and interpret results. Healthcare providers should discuss the limitations of laboratory tests used to diagnose Zika virus infection with pregnant women and their partners.
Protective Measures Recommendations for Pregnant Women
Pregnant women and their partners living in or traveling to Miami-Dade County should be aware of active Zika virus transmission and should strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites. (
https://www.cdc.gov/zika/prevention/prevent-mosquito-bites.html
). 
Women and men who live in or travel to Miami-Dade County should be aware of active Zika virus transmission, and those who are pregnant or have a pregnant sex partner should consistently and correctly use condoms to prevent Zika virus infection during sex or should not have sex during the pregnancy.
Women and Men Who are Planning to Conceive
Women and men who are planning to conceive in the near future should consider avoiding nonessential travel to red areas. 
Women with an epidemiologic link to the red areas and who do not have ongoing risks for exposure should wait at least eight weeks after symptom onset (if symptomatic) or after last possible exposure (if asymptomatic) to attempt conception. 
Men with an epidemiologic link to the red areas who do not have ongoing risks for exposure should wait at least six months after symptom onset (if symptomatic) or last possible exposure (if asymptomatic) to attempt conception. 
Women with an epidemiologic link to the yellow areas who do not have ongoing risks for exposure may consider waiting at least eight weeks from symptom onset (if symptomatic) or last possible exposure (if asymptomatic) to attempt conception. Although the level of risk in yellow areas is unknown, pregnant women are still at risk. Additionally, areas adjacent to or in proximity to red areas may have a greater likelihood of local transmission, so there may be a greater risk to pregnant women. 
Men with an epidemiologic link to the yellow areas who do not have ongoing risks for exposure may consider waiting at least six months from symptom onset (if symptomatic) or last possible exposure (if asymptomatic) to attempt conception. Although the level of risk in yellow areas is unknown, pregnant women are still at risk. Additionally, areas adjacent to or in proximity to red areas may have a greater likelihood of local transmission, so there may be a greater risk to pregnant women. 
People living in an area with possible Zika virus transmission should be counseled on the possible risk for Zika virus infection during the periconception period. Women and men should discuss their reproductive life plans with their healthcare provider in the context of potential and ongoing Zika virus exposure. Women and men with ongoing risks for exposure who are diagnosed with Zika virus disease should wait at least eight weeks and at least six months respectively, after symptom onset before attempting conception. 
There are limited data about the persistence of Zika virus RNA in body fluids, and the risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with maternal Zika virus infection around the time of conception is currently not known. Given this information, some couples in which one or both partners have had a possible Zika virus exposure might choose to wait longer or shorter than the recommended period to conceive, depending on individual circumstances (e.g., age, fertility, details of possible exposure) and risk tolerance. 
Women and men attempting conception living in or traveling to the Miami-Dade County should be aware of active Zika virus transmission and should strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites. (

Summary
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is advising hospitals to notify patients who underwent open-heart (open-chest) surgery involving a Stöckert 3T heater-cooler that the device was potentially contaminated, possibly putting patients at risk for a life threatening infection. New information indicates that these devices, manufactured by LivaNova PLC (formerly Sorin Group Deutschland GmbH), were likely contaminated with the rare bacteria 
Mycobacterium chimaera
 during manufacturing. Hospitals should advise potentially exposed patients to seek medical care if they are experiencing symptoms such as night sweats, muscle aches, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, or unexplained fever. In addition, hospitals that use or have used this device are strongly encouraged to make and execute a plan to communicate with potentially exposed patients and to increase awareness among healthcare providers.
Background
In the spring of 2015, investigators in Switzerland reported a cluster of six patients with invasive infection of 
M. chimaera
, a species of nontuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) commonly found in soil and water. The infected patients had undergone open-heart surgery that used contaminated heater-cooler devices during extracorporeal circulation (1). In July 2015, a Pennsylvania hospital also identified a cluster of invasive NTM infections among patients who had undergone open-heart surgery.  CDC assisted in a field investigation that used both epidemiologic and laboratory evidence to identify an association between invasive 
Mycobacterium avium
 complex (including 
M. chimaera
) infections and exposure to contaminated 3T heater-cooler devices, consistent with the Swiss report (2).
The water circuits in these heater-cooler devices that are used to regulate temperature during cardiopulmonary bypass do not come into direct contact with the patient’s circulating blood; however, these reports suggest that 
M. chimaera
 can be aerosolized by the devices and result in infections (1,2). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and CDC have issued alerts about the need to follow updated manufacturer’s instructions for maintenance and use of the devices, evaluate the devices for contamination, remain vigilant for new infections, and continue to monitor reports from the United States and overseas (2).
CDC in collaboration with National Jewish Health completed a whole-genome sequencing analysis and results demonstrate that 
M. chimaera
 isolates from patients with heater-cooler associated infections and from the 3T heater-cooler devices from several U.S. hospitals (in Pennsylvania and Iowa) are all highly related to each other (3). This evidence for likely point-source contamination of the 3T heater-cooler devices is consistent with recent reports from Europe (
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/AlertsandNotices/ucm504213.htm
External
) that describe matching of 
M. chimaera
 sequences from environmental isolates at the device production site in Germany and isolates from patients and devices in Europe.
More than 250,000 heart bypass procedures using heater-cooler devices are performed in the United States every year; the 3T heater-cooler device linked to these infections represents about 60% of the heater-cooler devices in the country (2,4). In hospitals where at least one infection has been identified, the risk of infection was between about 1 in 100 and 1 in 1,000 patients. Initial information suggests that patients who had prosthetic material implanted are at highest risk for NTM infections. These infections are difficult to treat and delays in diagnosis further complicate patients’ clinical management. Therefore, it is imperative that patients and providers are informed about the risk of infection associated with use of the 3T device and the need for appropriate diagnostic evaluation to facilitate timely diagnosis and treatment.
Recommendations
Healthcare providers
Internists, infectious disease specialists, cardiologists, cardiothoracic surgeons, and other clinicians should suspect NTM infections among patients who have signs of infection and a history of open-chest cardiac surgery.
Infections can take months to cause symptoms.
Patients with NTM infections following cardiac surgery have presented with a variety of clinical manifestations. Common examples are endocarditis, surgical site infection, or abscess and bacteremia. Other clinical manifestations have included hepatitis, renal insufficiency, splenomegaly, pancytopenia, and osteomyelitis. 
Diagnosis can be difficult due to the nonspecific presentation of illness and the slow growing nature of the bacteria.
Physicians should consider consulting with an infectious disease specialist if caring for patients who have undergone an open-chest cardiac procedure and present with signs of infection.
Cultures for acid fact bacilli (AFB) should be obtained as part of the evaluation.
Other specialized testing to detect 
M. chimaera
 may be needed and further laboratory testing should be discussed and arranged in consultation with an infectious disease specialist or health department.
Hospitals
Hospitals performing open-chest cardiac surgery should immediately assess their use of heater-cooler devices and determine whether they are currently using – or have previously used – 3T devices.  Facilities should ensure that they are implementing current FDA recommendations to minimize patient risk to infections associated with heater-cooler devices (
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/AlertsandNotices/UCM520191.htm
External
).
Hospitals should notify cardiothoracic surgeons, cardiologists, infectious disease physicians, internists, primary care physicians, and other clinicians who evaluate patients that have had open-chest cardiac or other bypass surgery, about the risk of infection associated with 3T heater-cooler devices. CDC has sample letters available at 
https://www.cdc.gov/hai/outbreaks/heater-cooler.html
Hospitals should review their facility’s microbiology laboratory database and records of surgical procedures for any positive NTM cultures in surgery patients that might indicate a possible case.  CDC has provided guidance on case-finding: 
https://www.cdc.gov/hai/pdfs/outbreaks/Guide-for-Case-Finding.pdf
Cdc-pdf
Hospitals should consider institution-specific strategies for alerting patients of the risk of infection related to potentially contaminated heater-cooler devices. CDC has sample patient notification letters available at 
https://www.cdc.gov/hai/outbreaks/heater-cooler.html
Hospitals can consider prospective surveillance of patients who have undergone open-chest cardiac surgery involving a 3T heater-cooler device.
Hospitals should consider using informed consent to educate patients of the potential NTM infection risk.
The overall risk of 
M. chimaera
 infection is low relative to other complications following cardiac surgery; emergent cardiac procedures should not be delayed because of the use of 3T devices. Continued use of 3T devices should be done in accordance with the latest manufacturer’s recommendations, including maintenance and proper positioning of devices to minimize the risk of patient exposure.
Hospitals that have identified contaminated 3T heater-cooler devices or patient infections associated with devices should promptly alert their local or state health department and submit a report to FDA via MedWatch at 
http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/DownloadForms/default.htm
External
Health Departments
Health departments should communicate with healthcare facilities that perform cardiac surgery using heater-cooler devices about the risk of 
M. chimaera
 infection associated with open-chest cardiac surgery involving use of the 3T heater-cooler devices.  Health departments should direct facilities to CDC and FDA heater-cooler guidance documents in these communications.

External
Health departments should track reports from healthcare facilities about potential infections associated with heater-cooler devices and encourage facilities to report these events to FDA.
Health departments should be prepared to assist healthcare facilities with further investigation; CDC is available for further consultation as needed.
Patients
Symptoms of NTM infection, including 
M. chimaera
 infection, can take months to appear. Patients should be aware of the symptoms of NTM infection which can include persistent or unexplained fever; night sweats; redness, heat, or pus around a surgical incision; muscle aches; unexplained weight loss; or fatigue.
Patients who have had cardiac surgery should seek medical evaluation if they have one or more of these symptoms or have questions about possible exposure to a heater-cooler device.

Summary
CDC previously issued travel, testing, and other guidance related to local mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission (active Zika virus transmission) that the Florida Department of Health (FL DOH) identified in two areas of Miami-Dade County: (1) a one-square-mile area in Wynwood, and (2) a 1.5-square-mile area in Miami Beach. CDC has updated the guidance for people who live in or traveled to these areas.
FL DOH continues to investigate active Zika virus transmission in South Florida. Investigation has shown an expanded area of active transmission in Miami Beach, now measuring 4.5 square miles, which includes the original 1.5-square-mile area.
The FL DOH has determined that active Zika virus transmission is no longer ongoing in the one-square-mile area of Wynwood after three mosquito incubation periods have passed without any new cases of local transmission. As of September 19, 2016, CDC has modified recommendations for the Wynwood area. CDC no longer recommends that pregnant women avoid travel to the Wynwood area. However, pregnant women and partners of pregnant women who are concerned about potential Zika virus exposure may consider postponing nonessential travel to all parts of Miami-Dade County, including areas without identified active transmission. For all of Miami-Dade County, CDC advises strict adherence to precautions to prevent mosquito bites.
Because the incubation period for Zika virus infection is up to two weeks and many people infected with Zika virus won’t have symptoms or will only have mild symptoms, it is likely that there are additional people infected in the population. In addition, because the diagnosis and investigation of cases may take several weeks, coupled with additional cases of local mosquito-borne Zika virus infection and increase in travel-related cases in Miami-Dade County, it is possible that other neighborhoods besides Miami Beach in Miami-Dade County have active Zika virus transmission that is not yet apparent.
For the newly expanded area of active transmission in Miami Beach, CDC advises that the recommendations outlined below be followed. As outlined in prior guidance, based on the earliest time of symptom onset and a maximal two week incubation period for Zika virus infection, these recommendations apply to pregnant women, women of reproductive age, and their partners who live in or traveled to the designated 4.5-square-mile area of Miami Beach after July 14, 2016.
This is an ongoing investigation, and FL DOH and CDC are working together to rapidly learn more about the extent of active Zika virus transmission in Miami-Dade County. CDC will update these recommendations as more information becomes available.
Recommendations
Miami Beach
1. Pregnant women should avoid travel to the identified 4.5-square-mile area of Miami Beach (
http//www.cdc.gov/zika/intheus/florida-update.html
) located in Miami-Dade County, because active Zika virus transmission has been confirmed in this area.
2. Pregnant women and their partners living in or traveling to the designated Miami Beach area should be aware of active Zika virus transmission and should strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites (
https://www.cdc.gov/zika/prevention/prevent-mosquito-bites.html
). Healthcare providers caring for pregnant women and their partners should visit CDC’s Zika website (
https://www.cdc.gov/zika/
) frequently for the most up-to-date recommendations.
3. Women and men who live in or traveled to the designated area of Miami Beach any time after July 14, 2016, should be aware of active Zika virus transmission, and those who have a pregnant sex partner should consistently and correctly use condoms to prevent infection during sex or should not have sex during the pregnancy.
4. Pregnant women with ongoing risk of possible Zika virus exposure include those who live in or frequently travel to the designated area of Miami Beach. Pregnant women with limited risk of Zika virus exposure include those who traveled to the designated area of Miami Beach or had sex without using condoms to prevent infection with a partner who lives in or traveled to the designated area of Miami Beach.
5. Pregnant women with ongoing or limited risk of exposure to Zika virus and signs or symptoms consistent with Zika virus disease should be tested for Zika virus infection based on time of evaluation relative to symptom onset in accordance with CDC guidance (
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6529e1.htm?s_cid=mm6529e1_e
).
6. Pregnant women with ongoing risk of possible Zika virus exposure who do not report symptoms of Zika virus disease should be tested in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy in accordance with CDC guidance (
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6529e1.htm?s_cid=mm6529e1_e
).
7. Pregnant women with limited risk of possible Zika virus exposure who do not report symptoms should consult with their healthcare providers to obtain testing for Zika virus infection based on the elapsed interval since their last possible exposure in accordance with CDC guidance (
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6529e1.htm?s_cid=mm6529e1_e
).
Wynwood
8. Women and men who live in or traveled to Wynwood should be aware that this location was considered an area of active Zika virus transmission from June 15 to September 18, 2016. Pregnant women who lived in or traveled to Wynwood during this time or had sex without using condoms to prevent infection with a partner who lived in or traveled to Wynwood during this time should talk to their healthcare provider about getting tested for Zika virus. People who lived in or traveled to this area during this time and have a pregnant sex partner should consistently and correctly use condoms to prevent infection during sex, or should not have sex during the pregnancy.
Additional Recommendations
9. Pregnant women and partners of pregnant women who are concerned about potential Zika virus exposure may also consider postponing nonessential travel to all parts of Miami-Dade County.
10. All pregnant women in the United States should be evaluated for possible Zika virus exposure and signs or symptoms consistent with Zika virus disease at each prenatal care visit. Each prenatal evaluation should include an assessment of signs and symptoms of Zika virus disease (acute onset of fever, rash, arthralgia, conjunctivitis), travel history, and exposure during sex to determine whether Zika virus testing is indicated. Healthcare provider should discuss the limitations of laboratory tests used to diagnose Zika virus infection with pregnant women and their partners.
11. CDC currently recommends that women with Zika virus disease should wait at least eight weeks after symptom onset to attempt conception, and men with Zika virus disease should wait at least six months after symptom onset to attempt conception with their partner.
12. Women and men with possible Zika virus exposure who do not report signs or symptoms consistent with Zika virus disease should wait at least eight weeks after last possible exposure to attempt conception.
13. Women and men with ongoing risk of possible Zika virus exposure who do not have signs or symptoms consistent with Zika virus disease and are considering pregnancy should consult their healthcare provider. Because of the ongoing risk of possible Zika virus exposure in the identified area in Miami-Dade County, healthcare providers should discuss the risks of Zika, emphasize ways to prevent Zika virus infection, and provide information about safe and effective contraceptive methods. As part of their pregnancy planning and counseling with their healthcare providers, some women and their partners living in the designated Miami Beach area might consider postponing pregnancy because of the possibility of exposure to Zika virus during pregnancy or the periconceptional period.
Background
Zika virus is spread to people primarily through the bite of an infected 
Aedes
 species mosquito (
Ae. aegypti
 and 
Ae
. 
albopictus
). Zika virus can also be sexually transmitted. Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause microcephaly and severe fetal brain defects and has been associated with other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Most people infected with Zika virus will not have symptoms; infants with microcephaly and other birth defects have been born to women with Zika virus infection who did not report symptoms.
CDC’s testing recommendations for pregnant women are the same for those with ongoing and those with limited risk for possible Zika virus exposure who report clinical illness consistent with Zika virus disease (symptomatic pregnant women). Symptomatic pregnant women who are evaluated less than two weeks after symptom onset should receive serum and urine Zika virus rRT-PCR testing. Symptomatic pregnant women who are evaluated 2 to 12 weeks after symptom onset should first receive a Zika virus immunoglobulin (IgM) antibody test; if the IgM antibody test result is positive or equivocal (unclear), serum and urine rRT-PCR testing should be performed.
Testing recommendations for pregnant women with possible Zika virus exposure who do not report clinical illness consistent with Zika virus disease (asymptomatic pregnant women) differ based on the circumstances of possible exposure. For asymptomatic pregnant women with ongoing risk for possible exposure who are evaluated less than two weeks after last possible exposure, rRT-PCR testing should be performed. If the rRT-PCR result is negative, a Zika virus IgM antibody test should be performed 2 to 12 weeks after the exposure. Asymptomatic pregnant women with limited risk for possible exposure who are first evaluated 2 to 12 weeks after their last possible exposure should first receive a Zika virus IgM antibody test; if the IgM antibody test result is positive or equivocal (unclear), serum and urine rRT-PCR should be performed. Asymptomatic pregnant women with ongoing risk for possible exposure to Zika virus should receive Zika virus IgM antibody testing as part of routine obstetric care during the first and second trimesters; immediate rRT-PCR testing should be performed when IgM antibody test results are positive or equivocal (unclear).
Further information on the interpretation of laboratory test results and clinical management of pregnant women with laboratory evidence of possible Zika virus infection are available below.","['https://www.cdc.gov/zika/intheus/florida-update.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/zika/prevention/prevent-mosquito-bites.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/zika/hc-providers/pregnant-woman.html']"

Summary 
On October 26, 2015, CDC issued HAN 384 (
http://emergency.cdc.gov/han/han00384.asp
) that alerted (1) public health departments, health care professionals, first responders, and medical examiners and coroners of the increase in fentanyl-related unintentional overdose fatalities in multiple states primarily driven by illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF) (i.e., non-pharmaceutical fentanyl); (2) provided recommendations for improving detection of fentanyl-related overdose outbreaks; and (3) encouraged states to expand access to naloxone and training for administering naloxone to reduce opioid overdose deaths.
The purpose of this HAN update is to alert public health departments, health care professionals, first responders, and medical examiners and coroners to new developments that have placed more people at risk for fentanyl-involved overdoses from IMF and may increase the risk of non-fatal and fatal overdose. These developments include the following: (1) a sharp increase in the availability of counterfeit pills containing varying amounts of fentanyl and fentanyl-related compounds (e.g., labeled as Oxycodone, Xanax, and Norco), (2) the potential for counterfeit pills containing fentanyl and fentanyl-related compounds to be broadly distributed across the United States which could impact states not previously impacted by IMF and persons using diverted prescription pills (i.e., licit drugs diverted for illicit purposes and involves the diversion of drugs from legal and medically necessary uses towards uses that are illegal and typically not medically authorized or necessary)[1], (3) the widening array of toxic fentanyl-related compounds being mixed with heroin or sold as heroin, including extremely toxic analogs such as carfentanil, and (4) continued increases in the supply and distribution of IMF (
https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/fentanyl-le-reports.html
).
Background
In July 2016, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) issued a nationwide report indicating that hundreds of thousands of counterfeit pills have been entering the U.S. drug market since 2014, some containing deadly amounts of fentanyl and fentanyl analogs [2]. Traditionally, fentanyl and fentanyl analogs in the illicit market have been mixed into heroin or sold as heroin, often without the knowledge of the consumer, and have primarily impacted areas where white powder heroin is prevalent, including the Northeast, Midwest, and Southeast regions of the United States. The influx of counterfeit pills, which closely resemble oxycodone [2,3], Xanax [3], and Norco [4,5], has increased the chance of fentanyl-involved overdoses among persons misusing prescription opioids or benzodiazepines who seek diverted medications on the illicit market [2], in addition to persons who inject, sniff, or snort drugs. Persons who misuse prescription pills are geographically widespread; thus, the potential risk for fentanyl overdose has spread beyond those regions previously known to be impacted by IMF, and could intensify the impact in regions already affected by IMF.
The supply, distribution, and potency of illicitly manufactured fentanyl and fentanyl-related compounds in the U.S. drug market is evolving. Carfentanil, an extremely potent fentanyl analog, has been detected in at least one state [6,7] and is currently being investigated as a possibility in a few other locations [8]. Designed in 1974, carfentanil was previously used exclusively for veterinary use with large animals and is not approved for use in humans, as it has been shown to be 100 times more potent than fentanyl in animal studies. Other fentanyl-related compounds have been reported by the DEA National Forensic Laboratory Information System (NFLIS), which systematically collects drug identification results from drug cases submitted for analysis to forensic laboratories (referred to as drug submissions). From 2014 to 2015 the number of drug submissions testing positive for acetyl fentanyl increased substantially, rising from 463 in 2014 to 1,870 in 2015[9,10,11], and in 2016, NFLIS reported increasing drug submissions testing positive for furanyl fentanyl (244 drug submissions from January to July 2016) [9]. States should be vigilant about the possibility of highly toxic fentanyl-related compounds becoming available in the illicit drug market, as well as other highly toxic synthetic opioid derivatives, such as U47700 [2,12].
NFLIS has reported that the overall supply of illicitly manufactured fentanyl appears to have substantially increased from 2014 to 2015, with the number of drug submissions testing positive for illicitly manufactured fentanyl doubling during this period (from 5,343 to 13,882). The number of states reporting more than 100 fentanyl submissions also increased during this period from 11 to 15 (
https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/fentanyl-le-reports.html
 [9]). Recently, according to NFLIS and National Seizure System (NSS) reports, the amount of fentanyl seized in the United States has nearly doubled; from October 2014 to September 2015, federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies seized a total of 167.7 kilograms of fentanyl, and through June, 2016, they seized 363.8 kilograms of fentanyl [9].
Recommendations
CDC suggests the following actions in response to the increased risk of fentanyl overdose from IMF due to the influx of fentanyl-laced counterfeit pills, the widening array of highly toxic fentanyl-related compounds, and the continued expansion and geographic spread of the IMF supply:
Improve detection of fentanyl outbreaks to facilitate effective response. 
Public health departments
:  

Explore methods for rapidly identifying drug overdose outbreaks through use of existing surveillance systems such as medical examiner data, emergency medical services data, near-real time emergency department data, and poison center data [13].
Consider engaging local poison centers to assist with treatment of patients (toll free phone number is 800- 222-1222).
Track and monitor geographic trends in fentanyl and heroin supply using DEA’s National Forensic Laboratory Information System (NFLIS) reports (see NFLIS Report
 
http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/nflis/spec_rpt_opioids_2014.pdf
Cdc-pdf
External
). National Heroin Threat Assessment Summaries (see NHTA Summary 
https://www.dea.gov/divisions/hq/2016/hq062716_attach.pdf
Cdc-pdf
External
) and alerts on the DEA website [2] to inform prevention and response efforts.
Raise awareness among key partners and stakeholders to the widening profile of those at risk for fentanyl overdose, which increasingly includes persons misusing diverted prescribed oral pain and sedative medications [2].
Track decedent demographics and known risk factors (e.g., drug type, recent release from an institution, previous overdose) to inform prevention efforts [14].
Develop general public health messaging about fentanyl, including fentanyl-laced counterfeit pills and fentanyl-related compounds that emphasizes the toxicity and potential lethality of the drug versus its high “potency. The messaging should include warnings of the highly variable content of fentanyl present in illicit products, which further elevates risk of overdose [12,15].
Medical examiners and coroners
:  

Screen for fentanyl in suspected opioid overdose cases in regions reporting increases in fentanyl seizures, fentanyl-related overdose fatalities, or unusually high spikes in heroin or unspecified drug overdose fatalities.
Screen specimens using an ELISA test that can detect fentanyl. Confirmatory gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of positive screens for fentanyl may either confirm the presence of fentanyl or suggest the presence of a fentanyl analog. [16]. When fentanyl screening is negative, or confirmatory testing is inconclusive, yet opioid or fentanyl overdose is highly suspected, consider specialized testing for fentanyl analogs, particularly if an increase in overdoses is occurring.
Law Enforcement:
 Law enforcement plays an important role in identifying and responding to increases in the distribution and use of illicitly manufactured fentanyl.  

Use extreme caution when handling suspected illicitly manufactured fentanyl, white powders, and unknown substances (see DEA warning 
https://www.dea.gov/divisions/hq/2016/hq061016.shtml
External
). Use appropriate safety precautions and personal protective equipment (see NIOSH Emergency Response Card 
https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ershdb/emergencyresponsecard_29750022.html
Prioritize and expedite laboratory testing of drug samples taken from drug overdose scenes, if possible.
Share data on fentanyl and fentanyl analog drug seizures with local health departments, medical examiners, and coroners.
Carry a supply of naloxone so that it can be administered immediately to mitigate the effects of the overdose. (See Recommendation 2 below.)
Laboratories:
 The following government forensic laboratories supporting law enforcement can provide assistance with reference materials or reference data on a case-by-case basis.

External
 Expand Use of Naloxone and Treatment
Health Care Providers:
Multiple dosages of naloxone may need to be administered per overdose event, because of fentanyl’s increased potency relative to other opioids. Orally-ingested counterfeit pills laced with fentanyl may require prolonged dosing of naloxone in the ED/hospital setting due to a delayed toxicity that has been reported in some cases [15].
Facilitate access to Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT). MAT is a comprehensive approach to addressing the needs of persons with opioid use disorders that combines the use of medication with counseling and behavioral therapies.  Providers should discuss treatment options with persons who have an opioid use disorder, and persons who have experienced an opioid-related overdose once they are stabilized.
Harm reduction organizations
:  

Expand naloxone access to persons at risk for opioid-related overdose and to their friends and family members [17].
 
Train those using drugs how to effectively administer naloxone and emphasize the importance of calling 911 immediately after recognition of an overdose, because naloxone that is available in the field may be insufficient to reverse the overdose.","['https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/fentanyl-le-reports.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/fentanyl-le-reports.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ershdb/emergencyresponsecard_29750022.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5729a1.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6426a3.htm']"

Summary
CDC has previously issued travel, testing, and other guidance for local mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission (active Zika virus transmission) for a one-square-mile area in the Wynwood area of Miami that the Florida Department of Health (FL DOH) identified. The guidance for those who live in or traveled to this area any time after June 15, 2016, remains in effect.
FL DOH continues to investigate active Zika virus transmission in South Florida. Investigation has revealed a new area of active transmission in a 1.5-square-mile section of Miami Beach. In addition, FL DOH has identified multiple other individual instances of mosquito-borne Zika virus infection and an increase in travel-related cases. 
Because the incubation period for Zika infection is up to two weeks, a high proportion of infected people have no symptoms, and the diagnosis and investigation of cases takes several weeks, coupled with these individual instances of mosquito-borne Zika virus infection and increase in travel-related cases, it is possible that other neighborhoods in Miami-Dade County have active Zika virus transmission that is not yet apparent.
For the identified area of active transmission in Miami Beach, CDC advises that the recommendations outlined below be followed. Based on the earliest time of symptom onset and a maximal two-week incubation period for Zika virus, this guidance applies to pregnant women, women of reproductive age, and their partners who live in or traveled to Miami Beach after July 14, 2016. 
For all other areas of Miami-Dade County, while further investigations are underway, CDC advises strict adherence to precautions to prevent mosquito bites. Consistent with the August 3 recommendation of the Florida Governor, pregnant women in these areas should be assessed for potential exposure to Zika virus and, when indicated, obtain laboratory testing.  Pregnant women and partners of pregnant women who are concerned about potential Zika virus exposure may also consider postponing nonessential travel to all parts of Miami-Dade County. 
This is an ongoing investigation, and FL DOH and CDC are working together to rapidly learn more about the extent of active Zika virus transmission in Miami-Dade County. CDC will update these recommendations as more information becomes available. 
Recommendations
Pregnant women should avoid travel to the designated area of Miami Beach (https://www.cdc.gov/zika/intheus/florida-update.html), in addition to the designate)d area of Wynwood, both located in Miami-Dade County, because active Zika virus transmission has been confirmed in both of these areas.
Pregnant women and their partners living in or traveling to the designated areas should be aware of active Zika virus transmission and should follow steps to prevent mosquito bites (
https://www.cdc.gov/zika/prevention/prevent-mosquito-bites.html
). Healthcare providers caring for pregnant women and their partners should visit CDC Zika website (
https://www.cdc.gov/zika/
) frequently for the most up-to-date recommendations.
Women and men who live in or who have traveled to the designated area of Miami Beach since July 14, 2016, should be aware of active Zika virus transmission, and those who have a pregnant sex partner should consistently and correctly use condoms or other barriers to prevent infection during sex or not have sex for the duration of the pregnancy. The same recommendation applies for women and men who live in or who have traveled to the designated area in Wynwood since June 15, 2016. 
Pregnant women and partners of pregnant women who are concerned about potential Zika virus exposure may also consider postponing nonessential travel to all parts of Miami-Dade County. 
All pregnant women in the United States should be assessed for possible Zika virus exposure and signs or symptoms consistent with Zika virus disease at each prenatal care visit. Women with 
ongoing risk
 of possible Zika virus exposure include those who live in or frequently travel to the designated areas of Miami Beach and Wynwood due to the possibility of active Zika virus transmission.  Women with 
limited risk
 of Zika virus exposure include those who traveled to the designated areas of Miami Beach and Wynwood or had sex without using condoms or other barrier methods to prevent infection by a partner who lives in or traveled to the designated areas of Miami Beach and Wynwood. Each prenatal evaluation should include an assessment of signs and symptoms of Zika virus disease (acute onset of fever, rash, arthralgia, conjunctivitis), travel history, and sexual exposure to determine whether Zika virus testing is indicated. Limitations of laboratory tests used to diagnose Zika virus infection should also be discussed with pregnant women and their partners.
Pregnant women with possible exposure to Zika virus and signs or symptoms consistent with Zika virus disease should be tested for Zika virus infection based on time of evaluation relative to symptom onset in accordance with CDC guidance (
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6529e1.htm?s_cid=mm6529e1_e
).
Pregnant women with 
ongoing risk
 of possible Zika virus exposure and who do not report symptoms of Zika virus disease should be tested in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy in accordance with CDC guidance (
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6529e1.htm?s_cid=mm6529e1_e
).
Pregnant women with 
limited risk
 of possible Zika virus exposure and who do not report symptoms should consult with their healthcare providers to obtain testing for Zika virus infection based on the elapsed interval since their last possible exposure in accordance with CDC guidance (
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6529e1.htm?s_cid=mm6529e1_e
).
Women with Zika virus disease should wait at 
least
 eight weeks after symptom onset to attempt conception, and men with Zika virus disease should wait at 
least
 six months after symptom onset.
Women and men with 
ongoing risk
 of possible Zika virus exposure who do not have signs or symptoms consistent with Zika virus disease and are considering pregnancy should consult their healthcare provider. Due to the ongoing risk of possible Zika virus exposure, healthcare providers should discuss the risks of Zika, emphasize ways to prevent Zika virus infection, and provide information about safe and effective contraceptive methods. As part of their pregnancy planning and counseling with their healthcare providers, some women and their partners living either of the two designated areas (Miami Beach and Wynwood) might consider if now is the right time to get pregnant due to the possibility of exposure to Zika virus during pregnancy or the periconceptional period.
Women and men with 
limited risk
 of possible Zika virus exposure and who do not report signs or symptoms consistent with Zika virus disease should wait at least eight weeks after last possible exposure to attempt conception.

Summary
 
The Florida Department of Health (FL DOH) has identified an area with local mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission (active Zika virus transmission) in Miami (
https://www.cdc.gov/zika/intheus/florida-update.html
). Based on the earliest time of symptom onset and a maximal two-week incubation period for Zika virus, this guidance applies to women of reproductive age and their partners who live in or traveled to this area after June 15, 2016.
This is an ongoing investigation, and CDC is rapidly learning more about the extent of active Zika virus transmission in the area identified by the FL DOH. With the recommendations below, CDC is applying existing guidance to the occurrence of Zika virus transmission in this area of Florida. As more information becomes available, we will update these recommendations.
 
Recommendations
 
Pregnant women should avoid non-essential travel to the area with active Zika virus transmission identified by the FL DOH.
Pregnant women and their partners living in or traveling to the area with active Zika virus transmission identified by the FL DOH should follow steps to prevent mosquito bites (
https://www.cdc.gov/zika/prevention/prevent-mosquito-bites.html
).
Women and men who live in or who have traveled to the area with active Zika virus transmission identified by the FL DOH and who have a pregnant sex partner should consistently and correctly use condoms or other barriers to prevent infection during sex or not have sex for the duration of the pregnancy.
All pregnant women in the United States should be assessed for possible Zika virus exposure during each prenatal care visit. Women with ongoing risk of possible exposure include those who live in or frequently travel to the area with active Zika virus transmission identified by the FL DOH. Women with limited risk include those who traveled to the area with active Zika virus transmission identified by the FL DOH or had sex with a partner who lives in or traveled to the area with active Zika virus transmission without using condoms or other barrier methods to prevent infection. Each evaluation should include an assessment of signs and symptoms of Zika virus disease (acute onset of fever, rash, arthralgia, conjunctivitis), their travel history as well as their sexual partner’s potential exposure to Zika virus and history of any illness consistent with Zika virus disease to determine whether Zika virus testing is indicated.
Pregnant women with possible exposure to Zika virus and signs or symptoms consistent with Zika virus disease should be tested for Zika virus infection based on time of evaluation relative to symptom onset in accordance with CDC guidance (
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6529e1.htm?s_cid=mm6529e1_e
).
Pregnant women with ongoing risk of possible Zika virus exposure and who do not report symptoms of Zika virus disease should be tested in the first and second trimester of pregnancy in accordance with CDC guidance (
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6529e1.htm?s_cid=mm6529e1_e
).
Pregnant women with limited risk and who do not report symptoms should consult with their healthcare providers to obtain testing for Zika virus infection based on the elapsed interval since their last possible exposure in accordance with CDC guidance (
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6529e1.htm?s_cid=mm6529e1_e
).
Women with Zika virus disease should wait at least eight weeks and men with Zika virus disease should wait at least six months after symptom onset to attempt conception.
Women and men with ongoing risk of possible Zika virus exposure who do not have signs or symptoms consistent with Zika virus disease and are considering pregnancy should consult their healthcare provider. Due to the ongoing risk of possible Zika virus exposure, healthcare providers should discuss the risks of Zika, emphasize ways to prevent Zika virus infection, and provide information about safe and effective contraceptive methods. As part of their pregnancy planning and counseling with their health care providers, some women and their partners living in the area with active Zika virus transmission identified by the FL DOH might decide to delay pregnancy.
Women and men with limited risk and who do not report signs or symptoms consistent with Zika virus disease should wait at least eight weeks after last possible exposure to attempt conception.
 
Background
 
Zika is spread to people primarily through the bite of an infected 
Aedes
 species mosquito (
Ae. aegypti
 and 
Ae. albopictus
). Zika virus can also be sexually transmitted. Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and severe fetal brain defects, and has been associated with other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Most persons infected with Zika virus will not have symptoms; infants with microcephaly and other birth defects have been born to women with Zika virus infection who do not report symptoms.
CDC’s testing recommendations for pregnant women with ongoing or limited risk for possible Zika virus exposure who report clinical illness consistent with Zika virus disease (symptomatic pregnant women) are the same. Symptomatic pregnant women who are evaluated less than two weeks after symptom onset should receive serum and urine Zika virus rRT-PCR testing. Symptomatic pregnant women who are evaluated two to 12 weeks after symptom onset should first receive a Zika virus immunoglobulin (IgM) antibody test; if the IgM antibody test result is positive or equivocal (unclear), serum and urine rRT-PCR testing should be performed.
Testing recommendations for pregnant women with possible Zika virus exposure who do not report clinical illness consistent with Zika virus disease (asymptomatic pregnant women) differ based on the circumstances of possible exposure. For asymptomatic pregnant women with ongoing risk for possible exposure and who are evaluated less than two weeks after last possible exposure, rRT-PCR testing should be performed. If the rRT-PCR result is negative, a Zika virus IgM antibody test should be performed two to 12 weeks after the exposure. Asymptomatic pregnant with limited risk for possible exposure who are first evaluated 2–12 weeks after their last possible exposure should first receive a Zika virus IgM antibody test; if the IgM antibody test result is positive or equivocal, serum and urine rRT-PCR should be performed. Asymptomatic pregnant women with ongoing risk for possible exposure to Zika virus should receive Zika virus IgM antibody testing as part of routine obstetric care during the first and second trimesters; immediate rRT-PCR testing should be performed when IgM antibody test results are positive or equivocal.
Further information on the interpretation of testing results and clinical management of pregnant women with laboratory evidence of possible Zika virus infection are available below.

Summary
 
Testing for Zika virus infection using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) molecular assays is now commercially available. When requesting Zika rRT-PCR testing from a commercial laboratory, providers should be aware that commercial laboratories performing rRT-PCR currently do not also offer Zika IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or confirmatory serologic testing (plaque reduction neutralization test, or PRNT). Therefore, if possible, providers should store a serum aliquot for subsequent Zika IgM ELISA testing if the rRT-PCR assay is negative. Otherwise, collection of an additional serum sample may be necessary.
 
Recommendations
 
rRT-PCR (molecular) testing should be performed for patients possibly exposed to Zika virus who have symptoms consistent with Zika virus infection
Providers who request molecular testing for Zika virus infection from a commercial testing laboratory are advised to retain and store in a refrigerator (2-8°C) an aliquot of the patient’s serum for subsequent Zika IgM ELISA testing if the rRT-PCR is negative
For specimens that are rRT-PCR negative from the commercial laboratory and no stored serum specimen is available, another serum specimen should be collected  within 12 weeks of symptom onset for Zika IgM ELISA testing
Appropriate samples for molecular testing are serum samples collected <7 days and urine samples collected <14 days after symptom onset. Urine should always be collected with a patient-matched serum specimen.
 
Background
 
Molecular assays for detection of Zika virus RNA are now commercially available under Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). CDC recommends molecular testing using rRT-PCR for serum samples collected <7 days and urine samples collected <14 days after symptom onset. A positive rRT-PCR test is confirmation of Zika virus infection. However, because of the decline in the level of viremia over time and possible inaccuracy in reporting of dates of illness onset, a negative rRT-PCR result does not exclude Zika virus infection. In such cases, CDC recommends serologic testing by ELISA for Zika IgM antibody.
Currently, commercial laboratories that offer rRT-PCR testing do not provide Zika IgM ELISA testing with PRNT confirmation and have no routine process to forward specimens to another testing laboratory. Therefore, when requesting Zika rRT-PCR testing from a commercial laboratory, providers should retain an aliquot of the serum for Zika IgM ELISA testing if the rRT-PCR testing is negative. Blood should be collected and processed per routine guidelines (collected in a serum separator tube with serum aliquots transferred to new vials), and one of the serum aliquots should be stored in a refrigerator (2-8°C) until it is known if additional IgM testing is indicated. If a serum aliquot cannot be stored or is not available, but further testing is indicated, a new blood sample should be collected. Serum samples for IgM testing should be collected from patients within 12 weeks of symptom onset. Providers should contact their local health department to discuss IgM testing of stored or newly collected serum from patients who are rRT-PCR negative.

Summary
 Determining serotype for 
Haemophilus influenzae
 (Hi) and serogroup for 
Neisseria meningitidis
 (Nm) is crucial for identifying potential outbreaks and determining appropriate public health responses. Several new commercial multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays capable of simultaneously testing a single specimen for an array of pathogens that cause blood infections, meningitis, or encephalitis are available. These assays can rapidly identify Hi and Nm species, but most do not determine serotype or serogroup. Laboratories should continue to perform culture and use validated, specific real-time PCR assays capable of detecting and differentiating all six serotypes (a-f) of Hi
 
and six serogroups (A, B, C, W, X, and Y) of Nm; otherwise, additional steps need to be taken including performing a reflex culture or at a minimum retaining a clinical sample for further testing.
Background
 CDC is aware of recent instances in which it was not possible to determine whether cases of Nm were part of a cluster due to the lack of serogroup data. For these cases, multiplex PCR assays capable of simultaneously testing a single specimen for an array of pathogens that cause blood infections, meningitis, or encephalitis were used. While such assays can rapidly identify Hi and Nm species, most do not determine serotype or serogroup. Detecting serotype and serogroup are important for identifying potential outbreaks and determining appropriate public health responses.
Recommendations
 Clinical, commercial, and state public health laboratories considering PCR for Hi and Nm should select assays capable of detecting and differentiating all Hi serotypes (serotypes a-f) and all Nm serogroups common in the United States (serogroups B, C, W, and Y).

Summary
  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is collaborating in a coordinated public health response to the Department of Defense (DoD) 
announcement on May 26 of the first 
mcr-1 
gene
 
found in bacteria from a human in the United States
External
 
http://aac.asm.org/content/early/2016/05/25/AAC.01103-16.full.pdf+html
External
. Escherichia coli
 (
E. coli
) bacteria carrying the 
mcr-1
 gene were found in a urine sample from a person in Pennsylvania with no recent travel outside of the United States who presented to a clinic with a urinary tract infection. The 
mcr-1
 gene makes bacteria resistant to the antibiotic colistin, which is used as a last-resort drug to treat patients with infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). The 
mcr-1
 gene exists on a plasmid, a small piece of DNA that is capable of moving from one bacterium to another, potentially spreading antibiotic resistance to other bacterial species. CDC is issuing this HAN notice as a reminder to U.S. healthcare facilities about recommendations to prevent antibiotic resistant infections and alert them to additional recommendations for detecting and reporting bacteria with the 
mcr-1 
gene.  
Background
In November 2015, a report from China first described plasmid-mediated colistin-resistance caused by the 
mcr-1
 gene. Following that report, retrospective investigations of historical isolates from outside the United States have identified the rare occurrence of 
mcr-1
 in Enterobacteriaceae from the 1980s. Bacteria with this resistance mechanism have now been identified from humans, food, environmental samples, and food animals in at least 20 countries around the world. Most reports to date have identified the 
mcr-1
 gene in 
E. coli
, but it has also been reported from 
Salmonella 
species, 
Shigella sonnei
, and 
Klebsiella pneumoniae
Three 
mcr-1
 producing 
E. coli
 have been identified in the United States as of June 7, 2016: one in a clinical specimen from a person in Pennsylvania and two from intestinal samples from pigs. The 
E. coli
 isolate from the patient was also resistant to antibiotics in at least five additional antibiotic classes, including cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, sulfonamides, aminoglycosides, and tetracyclines. The sample from one pig also was resistant to other antibiotics, including ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline. No additional resistance was found in the isolate from the second pig. The presence of the 
mcr-1
 gene on a plasmid means that colistin resistance can be shared with other more resistant bacteria such as CRE, raising the possibility that untreatable bacteria could develop. A rapid public health response is underway to identify and contain any potential spread from the patient. CDC laboratories have developed protocols for testing microorganisms for the 
mcr-1
 gene and are performing screening tests to see if people in contact with the patient with 
mcr-1
 might be colonized with this organism. CDC is increasing its surveillance of human samples from U.S. healthcare settings. CDC’s National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System, in collaboration with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), will continue to look for 
mcr-1
 mediated colistin resistance in enteric bacteria from humans, retail meat, and food animals.
Recommendations
Given the discovery of 
mcr-1
 in a person in Pennsylvania, CDC reiterates the importance of measures to prevent transmission of antibiotic resistant bacteria, including those resistant to colistin or carrying the 
mcr-1
 gene. CDC recommends the following:
Infection Prevention: 
Healthcare providers should follow 
Standard and Contact Precautions
 (
https://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/2007IP/2007ip_part3.html
) for any patients colonized or infected with antibiotic resistant bacteria, including patients who are found to have 
mcr-1 
mediated resistant organisms. Healthcare facilities should follow manufacturers’ instructions for device cleaning and reprocessing.
Laboratory Testing: 
If laboratories are testing to determine whether colistin can be used clinically, Enterobacteriaceae isolates with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to colistin of 4 µg/ml or higher should be tested for confirmation and the presence of 
mcr-1
. Thus far, all microorganisms that have contained the 
mcr-1
 gene can safely be tested in a biosafety level-2 (BSL-2) laboratory.
 
Isolates should be sent to CDC for confirmatory testing via the state or local public health department, per the 
CDC test directory
 (
https://www.cdc.gov/laboratory/specimen-submission/detail.html?CDCTestCode=CDC-10223
), if local testing is not available. The results and test method that were used for initial colistin testing should be included with any isolates submitted for confirmatory testing. CDC laboratories are in the process of validating a rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to detect 
mcr-1
 in bacteria with elevated colistin MICs. It is not necessary to test Enterobacteriaceae with intrinsic colisitin resistance (e.g., 
Proteus
, 
Providencia
, 
Morganella
, and 
Serratia
 species).  Additionally, since 
Enterobacter 
species often have MICs of >=2 mcg/ml to colisitin, they should be sent for 
mcr-1
 testing only if other risk factors exist, such as a recent history of travel outside the United States to a 
country where 
mcr-1
 has been found to be more common
External
 (
http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=21403)
External
Validation of Laboratory Testing: 
CDC is making test-bacteria with elevated colistin MICs, available to laboratories, researchers, and others through the 
FDA-CDC Antimicrobial Resistance Bacteria Isolate Bank
 (
https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/resistance-bank/
) for use in validation of colistin-resistance testing in U.S. clinical laboratories.
Environmental Cleaning
: Healthcare facilities should ensure rooms where patients with antibiotic-resistant infections have been placed receive thorough daily and terminal cleaning.
Reporting to Public Health: 
Healthcare facilities and laboratories should adhere to local reporting requirements for all antibiotic resistant infections. If Enterobacteriaceae with 
mcr-1
 are identified from patients, healthcare facilities and laboratories should notify local or state public health authorities as quickly as possible, and inform clinicians caring for the patient and responsible infection prevention staff.
Preparing food safely: 
Cook all meat, poultry, and fish to its 
proper internal temperature to kill bacteria

Summary
 On May 13, 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued 
interim guidance
 (
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6518e1.htm
) that recommends Zika virus rRT-PCR testing of urine collected less than 14 days after symptom onset, along with testing of patient-matched serum samples, for the diagnosis of suspected Zika virus infection (1). The purpose of this Health Alert Network (HAN) health update is to further disseminate information about the interim guidance to clinical and public health professionals.
Background
 Zika virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus. Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects. Zika virus infection is also associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome. Transmission of Zika can occur through mosquito bite, from a pregnant woman to her fetus, through sexual contact with an infected male, and possibly through blood transfusion. The most common symptoms of Zika virus disease are fever, rash, joint pain, or conjunctivitis. Other common symptoms include muscle pain and headache. Evidence from case reports and experience from related flavivirus infections indicate that the incubation period for Zika is likely a few to 14 days.
Diagnostic testing for Zika virus infection can be accomplished using molecular and serologic methods. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued 
Emergency Use Authorizations
External
 (EUA) (
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/EmergencySituations/ucm161496.htm
External
) for several diagnostic assays to detect Zika virus infection (2). The EUAs authorize real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays to detect Zika virus RNA in specified clinical sample types, and an immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect anti-Zika virus IgM antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. The CDC Trioplex rRT-PCR assay is authorized by FDA for Zika virus testing of urine and serum. Anti-Zika IgM antibodies develop during the first week of illness and persist for approximately 12 weeks following infection. However, extensive cross-reactivity can occur in flavivirus serological assays, and therefore additional tests, such as the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), are necessary to distinguish Zika virus infection from other flavivirus infections.
Although Zika virus RNA is unlikely to be detected in serum after the first week of illness, recent data suggest that Zika virus RNA can persist in urine for at least two weeks post symptom onset (3). Given this information, on May 13, 2016, CDC issued interim guidance on rRT-PCR testing for Zika virus RNA in urine (1). CDC now recommends that, for persons with suspected Zika virus disease, Zika virus rRT-PCR should be performed on both urine and serum specimens collected within 7 days after onset of symptoms. Zika virus rRT-PCR also should be performed on urine specimens collected within 14 days after onset of symptoms. A positive rRT-PCR result in either specimen confirms Zika virus infection. However, a negative rRT-PCR in a serum or urine sample collected at any time point after illness onset does not exclude Zika virus infection, and in these cases IgM antibody testing should be performed on serum.
CDC recommendations for Zika virus testing of serum and other clinical specimens remain unchanged at this time. Please contact your state or local health department to facilitate testing.
 
Recommendations for Health Care Providers and Public Health Practitioners
 
Collect urine samples within 14 days post symptom onset along with patient-matched serum samples for those who match CDC Zika virus clinical and/or epidemiological testing criteria for Zika virus infection.
Perform Zika virus rRT-PCR testing on urine, in conjunction with testing of serum using the appropriate molecular or serologic assay, based on days post symptom onset.
 
Additional Considerations
 
Further investigation is needed to determine the sensitivity and utility of Zika virus rRT-PCR on urine specimens collected >= 14 days after onset of symptoms: limited data in pregnant women suggest that viremia in serum might be prolonged in pregnancy (4, 5).

Summary: 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently published recommendations for protecting people against sexual transmission of Zika virus (1). As stated in that report, information about possible sexual transmission of Zika virus was based on one published report of transmission from a man to a woman, one published report in which Zika virus was detected in semen of a man with hematospermia, and one case of possible sexual  transmission then under investigation in Texas. An additional case of Zika virus detected in semen in a man was reported after the CDC recommendations were published (2).  As of February 23, 2016, CDC and state public health departments are investigating 14 additional reports of possible sexual transmission of the virus, including several involving pregnant women. While additional investigations are being completed, CDC is issuing this HAN Advisory as a strong reminder to state, local, and US territorial public health departments, clinicians, and the public to be aware of and adhere to current recommendations for preventing sexual transmission of Zika virus, particularly for men with pregnant partners. These recommendations may change as more information becomes available.
 
Background
CDC is working with state, local, and US territorial public health departments, US Government agencies, and international partners in response to outbreaks of Zika virus disease (Zika) in multiple territories and countries in the Americas. Accumulating evidence links maternal Zika virus infection with congenital microcephaly, miscarriages, and other adverse fetal outcomes (3). In addition, there are reports of a possible association with Guillain-Barré syndrome (4). No vaccine or specific antiviral drug is currently available to prevent or treat Zika.
Zika virus is spread primarily by the bite of infected 
Aedes 
species mosquitoes (most commonly, 
Aedes aegypti
). In areas where Zika virus transmission is ongoing, people should follow precautions to prevent mosquito bites (
https://www.cdc.gov/zika/prevention/
). Sexual transmission of Zika virus also can occur and is of particular concern during pregnancy. In early February 2016, the Dallas County Department of Health and Human Services announced an occurrence of sexually transmitted Zika infection (5). On February 5, 2016, following the confirmation of this Texas sexual transmission event, CDC published interim guidelines for preventing sexual transmission of Zika virus (1).
As of February 23, 2016, CDC and state public health departments are investigating 14 additional reports of possible sexual transmission of the virus, including several events involving possible transmission to pregnant women. In two of these new suspected sexual transmission events that have been investigated to date, Zika virus infection has been confirmed in women whose only known risk factor was sexual contact with an ill male partner who had recently travelled to an area with local Zika virus transmission; testing for the male partners is pending. For four additional suspected sexual transmission events, preliminary laboratory evidence (IgM antibody test) is available for the women, but confirmatory testing is still pending. For eight suspected events, the investigation is ongoing. In all events for which information is available, travelers reported symptom onset within 2 weeks prior to their non-traveling female partner’s symptom onset.
Because these reports suggest sexual transmission may be a more likely means of transmission for Zika virus than previously considered, CDC is issuing this HAN Advisory to underscore the importance of adhering to the interim guidance published on February 5 and outlined below. The recommendations, which apply to men who reside in or have traveled to areas with active Zika virus transmission (
http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/
) and their sex partners, will be revised as more information becomes available.
Recommendations for men and their pregnant partners
Men who reside in or have traveled to an area of active Zika virus transmission who have a pregnant partner should abstain from sexual activity or consistently and correctly use condoms during sex (i.e., vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse, or fellatio) for the duration of the pregnancy. Pregnant women should discuss their male partner’s potential exposures to mosquitoes and history of Zika-like illness (
https://www.cdc.gov/zika/symptoms
) with their health care provider; providers can consult CDC’s guidelines for evaluation and testing of pregnant women (6).
Recommendations for men and their nonpregnant sex partners
Men who reside in or have traveled to an area of active Zika virus transmission who are concerned about sexual transmission of Zika virus might consider abstaining from sexual activity or using condoms consistently and correctly during sex. Couples considering this personal decision should take several factors into account. Most infections are asymptomatic, and when illness does occur, it is usually mild with symptoms lasting from several days to a week; severe disease requiring hospitalization is uncommon. The risk for acquiring vector-borne Zika virus in areas of active transmission depends on the duration and extent of exposure to infected mosquitoes and the steps taken to prevent mosquito bites (
https://www.cdc.gov/zika/prevention
). After infection, Zika virus might persist in semen when it is no longer detectable in blood; studies to determine the duration of persistence in semen are not yet completed.
Accumulating evidence of sexual transmission suggests that exposure to Zika virus includes unprotected sexual contact with a symptomatic male partner who resides in or has traveled to an area of active Zika virus transmission. Zika virus testing is currently recommended to establish a diagnosis of infection in exposed persons with signs or symptoms consistent with Zika virus disease, and may be offered to asymptomatic pregnant women with possible exposure to Zika virus (6). However, interpretation of results is complex, and health care providers should contact their state, local, or territorial health department for assistance with arranging testing and interpreting results. At this time, testing of exposed, asymptomatic men for the purpose of assessing risk for sexual transmission is not recommended. Sexual transmission of Zika virus from infected women to their sex partners has not been documented, nor has transmission from persons who are asymptomatically infected.  Sexual transmission of many infections, including those caused by other viruses, is reduced by consistent and correct use of latex condoms.
As we learn more about the incidence and duration of seminal shedding from infected men and the utility and availability of testing in this context, recommendations to prevent sexual transmission of Zika virus will be updated.

Flu Season Begins: Severe Influenza Illness Reported
 
CDC urges rapid antiviral treatment of very ill and high risk suspect influenza patients without waiting for testing
 
Summary
 Influenza activity is increasing across the country and CDC has received reports of severe influenza illness. Clinicians are reminded to treat suspected influenza in high-risk outpatients, those with progressive disease, and all hospitalized patients with antiviral medications as soon as possible, regardless of negative rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT) results and without waiting for RT-PCR testing results. Early antiviral treatment works best, but treatment may offer benefit when started up to 4-5 days after symptom onset in hospitalized patients. Early antiviral treatment can reduce influenza morbidity and mortality.
Since October 2015, CDC has detected co-circulation of influenza A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, and influenza B viruses. However, H1N1pdm09 viruses have predominated in recent weeks. CDC has received recent reports of severe respiratory illness among young- to middle-aged adults with H1N1pdm09 virus infection, some of whom required intensive care unit (ICU) admission; fatalities have been reported. Some of these patients reportedly tested negative for influenza by RIDT; their influenza diagnosis was made later with molecular assays. Most of these patients were reportedly unvaccinated. H1N1pdm09 virus infection in the past has caused severe illness in some children and young- and middle-aged adults. Clinicians should continue efforts to vaccinate patients this season for as long as influenza viruses are circulating, and promptly start antiviral treatment of severely ill and high-risk patients if influenza is suspected or confirmed.
Recommendations
Clinicians should encourage all patients who have not yet received an influenza vaccine this season to be vaccinated against influenza. This recommendation is for patients 6 months of age and older. There are several influenza vaccine options for the 2015-2016 influenza season (see 
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6430a3.htm
 ), and all available vaccine formulations this season contain A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, and B virus strains. CDC does not recommend one influenza vaccine formulation over another.
Clinicians should encourage all persons with influenza-like illness who are at high risk for influenza complications (see list below) to seek care promptly to determine if treatment with influenza antiviral medications is warranted.
Decisions about starting antiviral treatment should not wait for laboratory confirmation of influenza. Clinicians using RIDTs to inform treatment decisions should use caution in interpreting negative RIDT results. These tests, defined here as rapid antigen detection tests using immunoassays or immunofluorescence assays, have a high potential for false negative results. Antiviral treatment should not be withheld from patients with suspected influenza, even if they test negative by RIDT; initiation of empiric antiviral therapy, if warranted, should not be delayed.
CDC guidelines for influenza antiviral use during 2015-16 season are the same as during prior seasons (see 
https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/antivirals/summary-clinicians.htm
 ).
When indicated, antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible after illness onset, ideally within 48 hours of symptom onset. Clinical benefit is greatest when antiviral treatment is administered early. However, antiviral treatment might still be beneficial in patients with severe, complicated, or progressive illness, and in hospitalized patients and in some outpatients when started after 48 hours of illness onset, as indicated by clinical and observational studies.
Treatment with an appropriate neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral drugs (oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, or intravenous peramivir) is recommended as early as possible for any patient with confirmed or suspected influenza who

is hospitalized;
has severe, complicated, or progressive illness; or
is at higher risk for influenza complications. This list includes:

children aged younger than 2 years;
adults aged 65 years and older;
persons with chronic pulmonary (including asthma), cardiovascular (except hypertension alone), renal, hepatic, hematological (including sickle cell disease), metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus), or neurologic and neurodevelopment conditions (including disorders of the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerve, and muscle such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy [seizure disorders], stroke, intellectual disability [mental retardation], moderate to severe developmental delay, muscular dystrophy, or spinal cord injury);
persons with immunosuppression, including that caused by medications or by HIV infection;
women who are pregnant or postpartum (within 2 weeks after delivery);
persons aged younger than 19 years who are receiving long-term aspirin therapy;
American Indians/Alaska Natives;
persons who are morbidly obese (i.e., body-mass index is equal to or greater than 40); and
residents of nursing homes and other chronic-care facilities.
Antiviral treatment can also be considered for suspected or confirmed influenza in previously healthy, symptomatic outpatients not at high risk on the basis of clinical judgment, especially if treatment can be initiated within 48 hours of illness onset.
Clinical judgment, on the basis of the patient’s disease severity and progression, age, underlying medical conditions, likelihood of influenza, and time since onset of symptoms, is important when making antiviral treatment decisions for outpatients.
While influenza vaccination is the best way to prevent influenza, a history of influenza vaccination does not rule out influenza virus infection in an ill patient with clinical signs and symptoms compatible with influenza. Vaccination status should not impede the initiation of prompt antiviral treatment.
Background
 Seasonal influenza contributes to substantial morbidity and mortality each year in the United States. In the most recent influenza season—the 2014-2015 season—CDC estimates that there were approximately 19 million influenza-associated medical visits and 970,000 influenza-associated hospitalizations [1]. The spectrum of illness observed thus far during the 2015-2016 season has ranged from mild to severe and is consistent with that of other influenza seasons. Although influenza activity nationally is low compared to this time last season, it is increasing; and some localized areas of the United States are already experiencing high activity. Further increases are expected in the coming weeks. Typically, influenza seasons begin with increases in influenza-like-illness and the percent of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories. Those indicators are rising at this time. Increases in severity indicators tend to lag behind. At this time, national surveillance systems that track severity are not elevated, but CDC will continue to watch for indications of increased severity from influenza virus infection this season.
Laboratory data so far show that most circulating flu viruses are still like the viruses recommended for the 2015-2016 influenza vaccines. CDC will continue to monitor circulating influenza viruses for changes that might impact vaccine effectiveness and publish these data weekly in FluView (
http:/www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/summary.htm
). CDC also is conducting epidemiologic field studies to determine vaccine effectiveness this season.","['https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6430a3.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/antivirals/summary-clinicians.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/summary.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/summary.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/acip/clinical.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6430a3.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/antivirals/summary-clinicians.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/clinician_guidance_ridt.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/infectioncontrol/healthcaresettings.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/infectioncontrol/peri-post-settings.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/infectioncontrol/ltc-facility-guidance.htm']"
CDCHAN00386,CDC Urging Dialysis Providers and Facilities to Assess and Improve Infection Control Practices to Stop Hepatitis C Virus Transmission in Patients Undergoing Hemodialysis,https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/han00386.asp,Health Advisory,"Wednesday, January 27, 2016, 10:30 EST (10:30 AM EST)","

 CDCHAN-00386
Summary
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has received an increased number of reports of newly acquired hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among patients undergoing hemodialysis. Infection control lapses in dialysis care could expose patients to HCV. Any case of new HCV infection in a patient undergoing hemodialysis should prompt immediate action. CDC is urging dialysis providers and facilities to:
1) Assess current infection control practices and environmental cleaning and disinfection practices within the facility to ensure adherence to infection control standards; 
 2) Address any gaps identified by the assessments; 
 3) Screen patients for HCV, following CDC guidelines, to detect infections, determine treatment potential, and halt secondary transmission; and 
 4) Promptly report all acute HCV infections to the state or local health department.
Background
CDC has received an increased number of reports of acute HCV infection among patients undergoing hemodialysis. Between 2014 and 2015, CDC has been contacted about 36 cases of acute HCV infection in 19 different hemodialysis clinics in eight states. While investigations are ongoing, so far, HCV transmission between patients has been demonstrated at nine of those clinics, based on epidemiologic and viral sequencing evidence. Lapses in infection control (e.g., injection safety, environmental disinfection, and hand hygiene) were commonly identified at these facilities. Although the exact means of transmission could not be discerned, these lapses all could potentially contribute to HCV transmission. The increase in acute HCV infections might be due, in part, to improved screening and awareness of the potential for HCV infection in the hemodialysis setting. Regardless, this increase underscores the widespread potential for patients to acquire serious infections during dialysis care. Dialysis facilities should actively assess and continuously improve their infection control, environmental cleaning and disinfection, and HCV screening practices, whether or not they are aware of infections in their clinic. Any case of new HCV infection in a patient undergoing hemodialysis is likely to be a healthcare-associated infection and should be reported to public health authorities in a timely manner. A recent publication describes a dialysis facility where an outbreak of HCV continued for five years before being detected, highlighting the importance of HCV screening to identify these infections early and prevent further transmission.1 HCV transmission can be prevented when proper infection prevention and environmental disinfection practices are consistently followed.
Recommendations
In response to the increased identification of HCV transmission in dialysis clinics, CDC recommends the following actions be followed:
Dialysis providers
Evaluate infection control practices in each facility and ensure adherence to infection control standards.

CDC has checklists and audit tools (
https://www.cdc.gov/dialysis/prevention-tools/index.html
) that providers can use to assess their practices, identify gaps, and improve infection control practices to protect patients.
 2
   
If gaps are identified, promptly address any issues to protect patients’ health and safety (
https://www.cdc.gov/dialysis/
).

Take action to improve injection safety (
https://www.cdc.gov/injectionsafety/
), hand hygiene (
https://www.cdc.gov/handhygiene/
) and routine environmental disinfection procedures, as appropriate.
Ensure staff are aware of and trained to implement infection control guidelines (
https://www.cdc.gov/dialysis/guidelines/index.html
) for hemodialysis settings.
3,4
 Facilities should provide regular (e.g., annual) training (
https://www.cdc.gov/dialysis/clinician/index.html
) of staff to ensure adherence to infection control recommendations.
3,4
Follow CDC recommendations for HCV screening of hemodialysis patients and management of patients who test positive:

CDC recommends that chronic hemodialysis patients be screened for HCV antibody
12,13 
(anti-HCV) (
https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/hcvfaq.htm
) upon admission to the dialysis clinic and every six months thereafter if susceptible to HCV infection.
5
  
For those patients with a positive anti-HCV test result, the test should be followed with a Nucleic Acid Test (NAT) for HCV RNA.
6
 Follow CDC recommendations for interpretation of test results and further actions.
7
 Ensure patients identified to have HCV infection are aware of the diagnosis and are referred to appropriate care and evaluation. Persons with chronic HCV infection, including those with end-stage renal disease, may benefit from treatment.
Immediately report any case of new HCV infection among patients undergoing hemodialysis to the state or local health department.
 5,8
New HCV infection can present as a change in anti-HCV status from negative to positive, in the absence of signs or symptoms.
Communicate test results to the patient and arrange for clinical evaluation for possible treatment of HCV infection.
Determine the HCV infection status of all other patients receiving care in the facility.
Be transparent. Inform patients if HCV transmission is suspected to have occurred within the facility, and explain steps being taken to address the problem.
Health departments
Investigate any acute HCV infection in a hemodialysis patient for a possible healthcare-associated etiology. 
9
Patients
If you do not know if you have or might have hepatitis C, ask your healthcare provider.
Ask your healthcare providers questions about your dialysis care, such as:

Do you follow CDC recommendations?
Do I need to be tested for hepatitis C virus?
What can be done to prevent me from getting an infection during my dialysis treatment?
Review educational resources for patients (
https://www.cdc.gov/dialysis/patient/index.html
) on dialysis safety and hepatitis C
10,11
https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/cfaq.htm
) provided by CDC and other partners.

Summary
In May 2015, the World Health Organization reported the first local transmission of Zika virus in the Western Hemisphere, with autochthonous (locally acquired) cases identified in Brazil. As of January 15, 2016, local transmission had been identified in at least 14 countries or territories in the Americas, including Puerto Rico (See Pan American Health Organization [PAHO] link below for countries and territories in the Americas with Zika virus transmission). Further spread to other countries in the region is likely.
Local transmission of Zika virus has not been documented in the continental United States. However, Zika virus infections have been reported in travelers returning to the United States. With the recent outbreaks in the Americas, the number of Zika virus disease cases among travelers visiting or returning to the United States likely will increase. These imported cases may result in local spread of the virus in some areas of the continental United States, meaning these imported cases may result in human-to-mosquito-to-human spread of the virus.  
Zika virus infection should be considered in patients with acute onset of fever, maculopapular rash, arthralgia or conjunctivitis, who traveled to areas with ongoing transmission in the two weeks prior to illness onset. Clinical disease usually is mild. However, during the current outbreak, Zika virus infections have been confirmed in several infants with microcephaly and in fetal losses in women infected during pregnancy. We do not yet understand the full spectrum of outcomes that might be associated with infection during pregnancy, nor the factors that might increase risk to the fetus. Additional studies are planned to learn more about the risks of Zika virus infection during pregnancy.
Healthcare providers are encouraged to report suspected Zika virus disease cases to their state health department to facilitate diagnosis and to mitigate the risk of local transmission. State health departments are requested to report laboratory-confirmed cases to CDC. CDC is working with states to expand Zika virus laboratory testing capacity, using existing RT-PCR protocols.
This CDC Health Advisory includes information and recommendations about Zika virus clinical disease, diagnosis, and prevention, and provides travel guidance for pregnant women and women who are trying to become pregnant. Until more is known and out of an abundance of caution, pregnant women should consider postponing travel to any area where Zika virus transmission is ongoing. Pregnant women who do travel to these areas should talk to their doctors or other healthcare providers first and strictly follow steps to avoid mosquito bites during the trip. Women trying to become pregnant should consult with their healthcare providers before traveling to these areas and strictly follow steps to avoid mosquito bites during the trip.
Background
Zika virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus transmitted primarily by 
Aedes aegypti. Aedes albopictus
 mosquitoes might also transmit the virus. Outbreaks of Zika virus disease have been reported previously in Africa, Asia, and islands in the Pacific.  
Clinical Disease
 
About one in five people infected with Zika virus become symptomatic. Characteristic clinical findings include acute onset of fever, maculopapular rash, arthralgia, or conjunctivitis. Clinical illness usually is mild with symptoms lasting for several days to a week. Severe disease requiring hospitalization is uncommon and fatalities are rare. During the current outbreak in Brazil, Zika virus RNA has been identified in tissues from several infants with microcephaly and from fetal losses in women infected during pregnancy. The Brazil Ministry of Health has reported a marked increase in the number of babies born with microcephaly. However, it is not known how many of the microcephaly cases are associated with Zika virus infection and what factors increase risk to the fetus. Guillain-Barré syndrome also has been reported in patients following suspected Zika virus infection.
Diagnosis
 
Zika virus infection should be considered in patients with acute onset of fever, maculopapular rash, arthralgia, or conjunctivitis who recently returned from affected areas. To confirm evidence of Zika virus infection, RT-PCR should be performed on serum specimens collected within the first week of illness. Immunoglobulin M and neutralizing antibody testing should be performed on specimens collected ≥4 days after onset of illness. Zika virus IgM antibody assays can be positive due to antibodies against related flaviviruses (e.g., dengue and yellow fever viruses). Virus-specific neutralization testing provides added specificity but might not discriminate between cross-reacting antibodies in people who have been previously infected with or vaccinated against a related flavivirus.
There is no commercially available test for Zika virus. Zika virus testing is performed at the CDC Arbovirus Diagnostic Laboratory and a few state health departments. CDC is working to expand laboratory diagnostic testing in states, using existing RT-PCR protocols. Healthcare providers should contact their state or local health department to facilitate testing.
Treatment 
 
No specific antiviral treatment is available for Zika virus disease. Treatment is generally supportive and can include rest, fluids, and use of analgesics and antipyretics. Because of similar geographic distribution and symptoms, patients with suspected Zika virus infections also should be evaluated and managed for possible dengue or chikungunya virus infection. Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be avoided until dengue can be ruled out to reduce the risk of hemorrhage. In particular, pregnant women who have a fever should be treated with acetaminophen. People infected with Zika, chikungunya, or dengue virus should be protected from further mosquito exposure during the first few days of illness to reduce the risk of local transmission.
Prevention
 
No vaccine or preventive drug is available. The best way to prevent Zika virus infection is to:
Avoid mosquito bites.
Use air conditioning or window and door screens when indoors.
Wear long sleeves and pants, and use insect repellents when outdoors. Most repellents, including DEET, can be used on children older than two months. Pregnant and lactating women can use all Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellents, including DEET, according to the product label.
Recommendations for Health Care Providers and Public Health Practitioners
Zika virus infection should be considered in patients with acute fever, rash, arthralgia, or conjunctivitis, who traveled to areas with ongoing transmission in the two weeks prior to onset of illness.
All travelers should take steps to avoid mosquito bites to prevent Zika virus infection and other mosquito-borne diseases.
Until more is known and out of an abundance of caution, pregnant women should consider postponing travel to any area where Zika virus transmission is ongoing. Pregnant women who do travel to one of these areas should talk to their doctors or other healthcare providers first and strictly follow steps to avoid mosquito bites during the trip. Women trying to become pregnant should consult with their healthcare providers before traveling to these areas and strictly follow steps to avoid mosquito bites during the trip.
Fetuses and infants of women infected with Zika virus during pregnancy should be evaluated for possible congenital infection and neurologic abnormalities.
Healthcare providers are encouraged to report suspected Zika virus disease cases to their state or local health department to facilitate diagnosis and to mitigate the risk of local transmission.
Health departments should perform surveillance for Zika virus disease in returning travelers and be aware of the risk of possible local transmission in areas where 
Aedes 
species mosquitoes are active.
State health departments are requested to report laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infections to CDC.",['https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/resources/vector-control.html']
CDCHAN00409,Seasonal Influenza A(H3N2) Activity and Antiviral Treatment of Patients with Influenza,https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/han00409.asp,Health Advisory,"December 27, 2017, 1030 ET (10:30 AM ET)","
Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  is providing: 1) a notice about increased influenza A(H3N2) activity and its  clinical implications; 2) a summary of influenza antiviral drug treatment  recommendations; 3) an update about approved treatment drugs and supply this  season; and 4) background information for patients about influenza treatment.
Background

In the  United States (U.S.), influenza activity has increased significantly over  recent weeks with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominating so far this season.  In the past, A(H3N2) virus-predominant influenza seasons have been associated  with more hospitalizations and deaths in persons aged 65 years and older and  young children compared to other age groups. In addition, influenza vaccine  effectiveness (VE) in general has been lower against A(H3N2) viruses than  against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 or influenza B viruses. Last season, VE against  circulating influenza A(H3N2) viruses was estimated to be 32% in the U.S.  CDC expects that VE could be similar this  season, should the same A(H3N2) viruses continue to predominate. For this  reason, in addition to influenza vaccination for prevention of influenza, the  use of antiviral medications for treatment of influenza becomes even more  important than usual. The neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) antiviral medications  are most effective in treating influenza and reducing complications when  treatment is started early. Evidence from previous influenza seasons suggests  that NAI antivirals are underutilized in outpatients and hospitalized patients  with influenza who are recommended for treatment.
This CDC Health Advisory  is being issued to—
Remind clinicians that influenza should be high on their list of possible  diagnoses for ill patients  because  influenza activity is increasing nationwide, and
Advise clinicians that all hospitalized patients and  all high-risk patients (either hospitalized or outpatient) with suspected  influenza should be treated as soon as possible with a neuraminidase inhibitor  antiviral. While antiviral drugs work best when treatment is started within 2  days of illness onset, clinical benefit has been observed even when treatment  is initiated later.
Recommendations
1. CDC Antiviral Recommendations for the 2017–2018  Season 
CDC  recommends antiviral medications for treatment of influenza as an important  adjunct to annual influenza vaccination. Treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors  has been shown to have clinical and public health benefit in reducing illness  and severe outcomes of influenza based on evidence from randomized controlled  trials, meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials, and observational  studies during past influenza seasons and during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.

2. All Hospitalized, Severely Ill, and High-Risk  Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Influenza Should Be Treated with  Antivirals 
Any patient with suspected or confirmed influenza in the following  categories should be treated as soon as possible with a neuraminidase  inhibitor:

1) Any patient who is hospitalized—treatment is recommended for  all hospitalized patients;

2) Any patient who has severe, complicated, or progressive illness—this  may include outpatients with severe or prolonged progressive symptoms or who  develop complications such as pneumonia but who are not hospitalized;

3) Any patient who is at higher risk for influenza complications but  not hospitalized. Patients in this group include—
children younger than 2 years (although all children younger than  5 years are considered at higher risk for complications from influenza, the  highest risk is for those younger than 2 years)
adults aged 65 years and older
persons with chronic pulmonary (including asthma), cardiovascular  (except hypertension alone), renal, hepatic, hematological (including sickle  cell disease), and metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus), or  neurologic and neurodevelopment conditions (including disorders of the brain,  spinal cord, peripheral nerve, and muscle such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy  [seizure disorders], stroke, intellectual disability [mental retardation],  moderate to severe developmental delay, muscular dystrophy, or spinal cord  injury)
people with immunosuppression, including that caused by  medications or by HIV infection
women who are pregnant or postpartum (within 2 weeks after  delivery)
people aged younger than 19 years who are receiving long-term  aspirin therapy
American Indians/Alaska Natives
people with extreme obesity (i.e., body-mass index is equal to or  greater than 40)
residents of nursing homes and other chronic-care facilities
3. Timing of Treatment and Implications for  Patient Evaluation, Treatment, and Testing 
Clinical  benefit is greatest when antiviral treatment is administered as early as  possible after illness onset.    Therefore, antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible  after illness onset and 
should not be delayed 
even for a few hours to  wait for the results of testing. Ideally, treatment should be initiated within  48 hours of symptom onset. 
However, antiviral treatment initiated later than  48 hours after illness onset can still be beneficial for some patients. 
A very  large observational study of more than 29,000 hospitalized influenza patients reported  that while the greatest clinical benefit was found when antiviral treatment was  initiated within 48 hours of illness onset, starting antiviral treatment more  than 2 days after onset had survival benefit in adults versus no treatment. 
6
  Also, a randomized, placebo-controlled study suggested clinical benefit when  oseltamivir was initiated 72 hours after illness onset among febrile children  with uncomplicated influenza.
7
 Clinical judgment, on the basis of the patient’s disease severity and  progression, age, underlying medical conditions, likelihood of influenza, and  time since onset of symptoms, is important when making antiviral treatment  decisions for outpatients, particularly those who are not at increased risk for  influenza complications.
Because of the importance of early treatment, 
decisions  about starting antiviral treatment should not wait for laboratory confirmation  of influenza
. Therefore, empiric antiviral treatment should generally be  initiated as soon as possible when there is known influenza activity in the  community. A history of current season influenza vaccination does not exclude a  diagnosis of influenza in an ill child or adult. During influenza season  especially, high-risk patients should be advised to call their provider  promptly if they have symptoms of influenza. It may be useful for providers to  implement phone triage lines to enable high-risk patients to discuss symptoms  over the phone. To facilitate early initiation of treatment, when feasible, an  antiviral prescription can be provided without testing and before an office  visit.
4. Influenza  Testing
Information  to assist clinicians about influenza testing decisions is available at 
https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/consider-influenza-testing.htm
. The most  accurate influenza tests are molecular assays. Rapid molecular assays are  available in clinical settings that can detect influenza virus nucleic acids in  respiratory specimens in 15-30 minutes with high sensitivity and specificity.  Other approved molecular assays can yield results in 60-80 minutes or in  several hours with very high sensitivity and specificity.
For  hospitalized patients with suspected influenza, molecular assays are  recommended. Information on influenza molecular assays is available at 
https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/molecular-assays.htm
 Rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) with an analyzer device  can detect influenza A and B viral nucleoprotein antigens in respiratory  specimens in 10-15 minutes with moderate sensitivity, and RIDTs without an  analyzer device have low to moderate sensitivity compared with reverse  transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
Proper interpretation of influenza testing results is important to  guide optimal management of influenza patients. An algorithm to assist  clinicians in interpreting the results of influenza testing when influenza  viruses ARE circulating in the community is available at 
https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/algorithm-results-circulating.htm
. 
Clinicians  should be aware that a negative RIDT result does not exclude a diagnosis of  influenza in a patient with suspected influenza when there is influenza  activity in the community. 
Other factors such as the quality of the  specimen, the source of the specimen in the respiratory tract, and the timing  of specimen collection in relationship to illness onset, may also affect test  results.
5. Antivirals in Non-High Risk Patients with  Uncomplicated Influenza 
Neuraminidase  inhibitors can benefit other individuals with influenza. While current guidance  focuses on antiviral treatment of those with severe illness or at high risk of  complications from influenza, antiviral treatment may be prescribed on the  basis of clinical judgment for any previously healthy (non-high risk)  outpatient with suspected or confirmed influenza who presents within 2 days  after illness onset. Neuraminidase inhibitors can reduce the duration of  uncomplicated influenza illness by approximately 1 day when started within 2  days after illness onset in otherwise healthy persons. It is possible that  antiviral treatment started after 48 hours may offer some benefit. 
7
6. Antiviral Medications 
Three  prescription neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral medications are approved by the  U.S. Food and Drug

Administration  (FDA) and are recommended for use in the U.S. during the 2017–2018 influenza  season: oseltamivir (available as a generic version or under the trade name  Tamiflu®), zanamivir (Relenza®), and peramivir (Rapivab®).
Oral oseltamivir is FDA-approved for treatment of uncomplicated  influenza within 2 days of illness onset in persons aged 2 weeks and older, and  for chemoprophylaxis to prevent influenza in people 1 year of age and older.  Although not part of the FDA-approved indications, use of oral oseltamivir for  treatment of influenza in infants younger than 14 days old, and for  chemoprophylaxis in infants 3 months to 1 year of age, is recommended by CDC  and the American Academy of Pediatrics. Due to limited data, use of oseltamivir  for chemoprophylaxis is not recommended in children younger than 3 months  unless the situation is judged critical. CDC recommends oseltamivir treatment  as soon as possible for hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed  influenza, high-risk outpatients with suspected or confirmed influenza, and  those with progressive disease.
Inhaled zanamivir is FDA-approved for treatment of uncomplicated  influenza within 2 days of illness onset in persons 7 years and older and for  prevention of influenza in persons 5 years and older. Inhaled zanamivir is not  recommended for treatment of influenza in hospitalized patients due to limited  data.
Intravenous peramivir is FDA-approved for the treatment of acute  uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset in persons aged 2 years and older.
Adamantanes (rimantadine and amantadine) are  not currently recommended for antiviral treatment or chemoprophylaxis of  influenza A because of high levels of resistance among circulating influenza A  viruses
There are  no current national shortages of neuraminidase inhibitors (i.e., oseltamivir,  zanamivir and peramivir), and manufacturers report they expect to meet  projected seasonal demands. If there is difficulty locating oseltamivir for oral  suspension, as there has been in some previous seasons, oral suspension can be  compounded by a pharmacy from oseltamivir capsules. However, this compounded  suspension should not be used for convenience or when oseltamivir oral  suspension is commercially available.
More  information about compounding an oral suspension from oseltamivir 75 mg  capsules can be found at

Additional  Considerations for Clinicians 
Bacterial  Infections:
 Antibiotics are not effective against influenza virus infection,  and early diagnosis of influenza can reduce the inappropriate use of  antibiotics if bacterial co-infection is not suspected. However, because  certain bacterial infections can produce symptoms similar to influenza and  bacterial infections can occur as a complication of influenza, bacterial  infections should be considered and appropriately treated, if suspected. In  addition, because pneumococcal infections are a serious complication of  influenza infection, current pneumococcal vaccine recommendations for adults 65  years of age or older, as well as adults and children at increased risk for  invasive pneumococcal disease due to chronic underlying medical conditions,  should be followed (see 
http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pneumo/vac-PCV13-adults.htm
 and 
http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pneumo/vacc-in-short.htm
 for  further information).
Adverse  Events and Antiviral Use
: The most common adverse events associated  with oral oseltamivir include a slightly increased risk of nausea and vomiting as  compared to placebo, with nausea occurring in 10% of adults with influenza who  received oseltamivir and 6% of people who received placebo in controlled  clinical trials (3% and 4%, respectively, in children), and vomiting occurring  in 9% of adults with influenza who received oseltamivir and 3% of people who  received placebo in controlled clinical trials (15% and 9%, respectively, in  children). These symptoms are generally transient and can be mitigated if  oseltamivir is taken with food. Adverse events for inhaled zanamivir were not  increased as compared to placebo in clinical trials, but cases of bronchospasm  have been reported during post marketing; inhaled zanamivir is not recommended  for persons with underlying airways disease (e.g., asthma or chronic  obstructive pulmonary diseases). For people who received peramivir  intravenously or intramuscularly in clinical trials, the most common adverse  event was diarrhea, occurring in 8% versus 7% in people who received placebo.
Resources for Patient Education 
Results  from unpublished CDC qualitative research shows that most people interviewed  were not aware that drugs to treat influenza illness are available. A fact  sheet for patients is available at 
http://www.cdc.gov/flu/antivirals/whatyoushould.htm
Note the following important background  information for patients
If  you get the flu, antiviral drugs are a treatment option.
It  is very important that antiviral drugs are used early to treat hospitalized  patients, people with severe flu illness, and people who are at high risk for  flu complications because of their age, severity of illness, or underlying  medical conditions.
If  you have severe illness or are at high risk of serious flu complications, you  may be treated with flu antiviral drugs if you get the flu.
If  you have a high-risk condition, treatment with an antiviral drug can mean the  difference between having milder illness instead of very serious illness that  could result in a hospital stay.
Other  people also may be treated with antiviral drugs by their doctor this season.  Most otherwise-healthy people who get the flu, however, do not need to be  treated with antiviral drugs.
Studies  show that flu antiviral drugs work best for treatment when they are started  within 2 days of getting sick. However, starting antivirals later can still be  helpful for some people.
If  your health care provider thinks you have the flu, your health care provider  may prescribe antiviral drugs. A test for flu is not necessary.
Antibiotics  are not effective against the flu. Using antibiotics inappropriately can lead  to antibiotic resistance and may expose patients to unwanted side effects of  the drug.
Other  practices that may help decrease the spread of influenza include respiratory  hygiene, cough etiquette, social distancing (e.g., staying home from work and  school when ill, staying away from people who are sick) and hand washing.

CDCHAN-00408
Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is working with federal, state, territorial, and local agencies and global health partners in response to recent hurricanes. CDC is aware of media reports and anecdotal accounts of various infectious diseases in hurricane-affected areas, including Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands (USVI). Because of compromised drinking water and decreased access to safe water, food, and shelter, the conditions for outbreaks of infectious diseases exist.
The purpose of this HAN advisory is to remind clinicians assessing patients currently in or recently returned from hurricane-affected areas to be vigilant in looking for certain infectious diseases, including leptospirosis, dengue, hepatitis A, typhoid fever, vibriosis, and influenza. Additionally, this Advisory provides guidance to state and territorial health departments on enhanced disease reporting.
 
Background

Hurricanes Irma and Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico and USVI in September 2017, causing widespread flooding and devastation. Natural hazards associated with the storms continue to affect many areas. Infectious disease outbreaks of diarrheal and respiratory illnesses can occur when access to safe water and sewage systems are disrupted and personal hygiene is difficult to maintain. Additionally, vector borne diseases can occur due to increased mosquito breeding in standing water; both Puerto Rico and USVI are at risk for outbreaks of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya.
Health care providers and public health practitioners should be aware that post-hurricane environmental conditions may pose an increased risk for the spread of infectious diseases among patients in or recently returned from hurricane-affected areas; including leptospirosis, dengue, hepatitis A, typhoid fever, vibriosis, and influenza. The period of heightened risk may last through March 2018, based on current predictions of full restoration of power and safe water systems in Puerto Rico and USVI.
In addition, providers in health care facilities that have experienced water damage or contaminated water systems should be aware of the potential for increased risk of infections in those facilities due to invasive fungi, nontuberculous 
Mycobacterium 
species, 
Legionella 
species, and other Gram-negative bacteria associated with water (e.g., 
Pseudomonas), 
especially among critically ill or immunocompromised patients.
Cholera has not occurred in Puerto Rico or USVI in many decades and is not expected to occur post-hurricane.
 
Recommendations
These recommendations apply to healthcare providers treating patients in Puerto Rico and USVI, as well as those treating patients in the continental US who recently traveled in hurricane-affected areas (e.g., within the past 4 weeks), during the period of September 2017 – March 2018.
Health care providers and public health practitioners in hurricane-affected areas should look for community and healthcare-associated infectious diseases.
Health care providers in the continental US are encouraged to ask patients about recent travel (e.g., within the past 4 weeks) to hurricane-affected areas.
All healthcare providers should consider less common infectious disease etiologies in patients presenting with evidence of acute respiratory illness, gastroenteritis, renal or hepatic failure, wound infection, or other febrile illness. Some particularly important infectious diseases to consider include leptospirosis, dengue, hepatitis A, typhoid fever, vibriosis, and influenza.
In the context of limited laboratory resources in hurricane-affected areas, health care providers should contact their territorial or state health department if they need assistance with ordering specific diagnostic tests.
For certain conditions, such as leptospirosis, empiric therapy should be considered pending results of diagnostic tests— treatment for leptospirosis is most effective when initiated early in the disease process. Providers can contact their territorial or state health department or CDC for consultation.
Local health care providers are strongly encouraged to report patients for whom there is a high level of suspicion for leptospirosis, dengue, hepatitis A, typhoid, and vibriosis to their local health authorities, while awaiting laboratory confirmation.
Confirmed cases of leptospirosis, dengue, hepatitis A, typhoid fever, and vibriosis should be 
immediately
 reported to the territorial or state health department to facilitate public health investigation and, as appropriate, mitigate the risk of local transmission. While some of these conditions are not listed as reportable conditions in all states, they are conditions of public health importance and should be reported.

Summary: 
The Texas Department of State Health Services, with assistance from CDC, is investigating 
Brucella
 RB51 exposures and illnesses that may be connected to the purchase and consumption of raw (unpasteurized) milk from K-Bar Dairy in Paradise, Texas. Symptoms of brucellosis can include: fever, sweats, malaise, anorexia, headache, fatigue, muscle & joint pain, and potentially more serious complications (e.g., swelling of heart, liver, or spleen, neurologic symptoms).
Background
A person who drank raw milk from K-Bar Dairy in Paradise, Texas, has been hospitalized with brucellosis. Milk samples from the dairy have tested positive for a 
Brucella
 strain called RB51. People who consumed milk or milk products from this dairy from June 1, 2017, to August 7, 2017 are at an increased risk for brucellosis and should receive appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). They are advised to consult with their health care providers regarding PEP care and possible diagnostic testing. Please note: the incubation period for brucellosis can range from five days to six months.
Recommendations
Brucella 
strain RB51 is resistant to rifampin and penicillin. A combination of doxycycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for 21 days is the recommended first-line PEP regimen for RB51 exposure. There is no serological test available to detect RB51 infection. Blood culture is the recommended diagnostic test for exposed symptomatic individuals. When ordering blood cultures to diagnose brucellosis, please advise the laboratory that blood culture may grow 
Brucella
 and that appropriate laboratory
1
 precautions should be observed. If brucellosis occurs despite prophylaxis, treatment regimens
2
 should be selected based on antimicrobial susceptibility results. Please see the diagram below for information on developing an evaluation and treatment plan for exposed patients. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should consult with their health care provider.

CDCHAN00406,Hurricane Harvey—Clinical Guidance for Carbon Monoxide (CO) Poisoning,https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/han00406.asp,Health Advisory,"September 02, 2017, 2130 ET (9:30 PM ET)","
Distributed via the CDC Health Alert Network

CDCHAN-00406
Summary
Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless, poisonous gas that can cause sudden illness and death if present in sufficient concentration in the ambient air. During a significant power outage, persons using alternative fuel or power sources such as generators or gasoline powered engine tools such as pressure washers might be exposed to toxic CO levels if the fuel or power sources are placed inside or too close to the exterior of the building causing CO to build up in the structure. The purpose of this HAN advisory is to remind clinicians evaluating persons affected by the storm to maintain a high index of suspicion for CO poisoning. Clinicians are advised to consider CO exposure and take steps to discontinue exposure to CO. Clinicians are also advised to ask a patient with CO poisoning about other people who may be exposed to the same CO exposure, such as persons living with or visiting them so they may be treated for possible CO poisoning.
Background
Hurricane Harvey made landfall between Port Aransas and Port O’Connor, Texas on August 25, 2017, causing 300,000 persons to lose power. When power outages occur during emergencies such as hurricanes or winter storms, the use of alternative sources of fuel or electricity for heating, cooling, or cooking can cause CO to build up in a home, garage, or camper and poison the people and animals inside. Although CO poisoning can be fatal to anyone, children, pregnant women, and older adults as well as persons with chronic illness are particularly vulnerable to CO poisoning. The symptoms and signs of CO poisoning are variable and nonspecific. The most common symptoms of CO poisoning are headache, dizziness, weakness, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, and altered mental status. Symptoms of severe CO poisoning include malaise, shortness of breath, headache, nausea, chest pain, irritability, ataxia, altered mental status, other neurologic symptoms, loss of consciousness, coma, and death. Signs and clinical manifestations of severe CO poisoning include tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, various neurologic findings including impaired memory, cognitive and sensory disturbances, metabolic acidosis, arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia or infarction, and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, although any organ system might be involved.
An elevated carboxyhemoglobin (COHgb) level of 2% or higher for non-smokers and 9% or higher COHgb level for smokers strongly supports a diagnosis of CO poisoning. The COHgb level must be interpreted in light of the patient’s exposure history and length of time away from CO exposure, as levels gradually fall once the patient is removed from the exposure.
With a focused history, exposure to a CO source may become apparent; items in the history that might trigger a higher index of suspicion for CO poisoning in this setting include lack of a fever, recurrent symptoms, and multiple family members affected by similar symptoms. Appropriate and prompt diagnostic testing and treatment are crucial to reduce morbidity and prevent mortality from CO poisoning.
Recommendations

CDC recommends that clinicians:
Consider CO poisoning in persons affected by Hurricane Harvey, particularly persons who are currently without power. All people affected by the storm should be advised about safe practices related to generators, grills, camp stoves, or other gasoline, propane, natural gas, or charcoal-burning devices, including that these devices should never be used inside a home, basement, garage, or camper — or even outside near an open window or window air conditioner. Please see 
https://www.cdc.gov/co/pdfs/generators.pdf
Cdc-pdf
Ask patients presenting for treatment who are affected by Harvey about symptoms consistent with CO poisoning. Clinicians should also ask about exposure to any fuel or power sources that place a person at increased risk for CO poisoning, including gas-powered generators, charcoal grills, propane stoves, charcoal briquettes, and other indoor heating and cooking devices.  Evaluation should also include examination for other conditions, including smoke inhalation, trauma, medical illness, or intoxication.
Administer 100% oxygen to persons in whom a diagnosis of CO poisoning is known or suspected until the patient is symptom-free or until a diagnosis of CO poisoning has been ruled out. Duration of oxygen treatment in persons with CO poisoning is usually about 4–5 hours.","['https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/co_guidance.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/co_guidance.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/co_guidance.html']"

Summary
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), State and Local Health Departments, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are investigating an increase in reported cases of cyclosporiasis. The purpose of this HAN Advisory is to notify public health departments and healthcare facilities and to provide guidance to healthcare providers of the increase in reported cases. Please disseminate this information to healthcare providers in hospitals and emergency rooms, to primary care providers, and to microbiology laboratories.
Healthcare providers should consider a diagnosis of cyclosporiasis in patients with prolonged or remitting-relapsing diarrheal illness. Testing for 
Cyclospora
 is not routinely done in most U.S. laboratories, even when stool is tested for parasites. Healthcare providers must specifically order testing for 
Cyclospora,
 whether testing is requested by ova and parasite (O&P) examination, by molecular methods, or by a gastrointestinal pathogen panel test. Cyclosporiasis is a nationally notifiable disease; healthcare providers should report suspect and confirmed cases of infection to public health authorities.
Background
Cyclosporiasis is an intestinal illness caused by the parasite 
Cyclospora cayetanensis.
 People can become infected with 
Cyclospora
 by consuming food or water contaminated with the parasite; it is not transmitted directly from one person to another person. The most common symptom of cyclosporiasis is watery diarrhea, which can be profuse. Other common symptoms include anorexia, fatigue, weight loss, nausea, flatulence, abdominal cramping, and myalgia; vomiting and low-grade fever may also occur. Symptoms of cyclosporiasis begin an average of 7 days (range: 2 days to ≥2 weeks) after ingestion of the parasite. If untreated, the illness may last for a few days to a month or longer, and may have a remitting-relapsing course. The treatment of choice for cyclosporiasis is trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). No effective alternative treatments have yet been identified for persons who are allergic to or cannot tolerate TMP/SMX, thus observation and symptomatic care is recommended for these patients.
Cyclosporiasis occurs in many countries but is more common in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Previous outbreaks in the United States have been linked to various types of imported fresh produce (e.g., basil, cilantro, mesclun lettuce, raspberries, and snow peas). To date, no commercially frozen or canned produce has been implicated. In the United States, most of the reported cases and outbreaks have occurred during the spring and summer months, especially during May through August or September.
As of August 2, 2017, 206 cases of 
Cyclospora
 infections have been reported to CDC in persons who became infected in the United States and became ill on or after May 1, 2017. These cases have been reported from 27 states, most of which have reported relatively few cases. Eighteen cases reported hospitalization; no deaths have been reported. At this time, no specific vehicle of interest has been identified, and investigations to identify a potential source of infection are ongoing. It is too early to say whether cases of 
Cyclospora
 infection in different states are related to each other and/or to the same food item(s).
The number of cases (206) reported in 2017, is higher than the number of cases reported by this date in 2016. As of August 3, 2016, 88 
Cyclospora
 infections had been reported in persons who became infected in the United States and became ill on or after May 1, 2016.
Recommendations for Healthcare Providers
Consider a diagnosis of cyclosporiasis in patients who have prolonged or remitting-relapsing diarrheal illness.
If indicated, healthcare providers should specifically order testing for 
Cyclospora,
 whether testing is requested by ova and parasite (O&P) examination, by molecular methods, or by a gastrointestinal pathogen panel test. Several stool specimens may be required because 
Cyclospora 
oocysts may be shed intermittently and at low levels, even in persons with profuse diarrhea.
Report cases to local health departments. Contact the local health department if assistance is needed with reporting or submitting specimens.",[]

Summary
Eculizumab (Soliris®) recipients have a 1,000 to 2,000-fold greater risk of invasive meningococcal disease compared to the general U.S. population. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved prescribing information for eculizumab includes a black box warning for increased risk of meningococcal disease, and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends meningococcal vaccination for all patients receiving eculizumab. Recent data show that some patients receiving eculizumab who were vaccinated with the recommended meningococcal vaccines still developed meningococcal disease, most often from nongroupable 
Neisseria meningitidis
, which rarely causes invasive disease in healthy individuals.
Background
Eculizumab is most commonly prescribed for treatment of 2 rare blood disorders: atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Through a request for data on meningococcal disease cases reported to state health departments, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified 16 cases of meningococcal disease in eculizumab recipients in the United States from 2008 through 2016; 11 (69%) of these were caused by nongroupable 
N. meningitidis
. Meningococcal conjugate (MenACWY) vaccine targets serogroups A, C, W, and Y, and provides no protection against nongroupable 
N. meningitidis
. Serogroup B meningococcal (MenB) vaccines are licensed specifically for protection against serogroup B meningococcal disease. Researchers have not assessed the extent of any potential cross protection for nongroupable 
N. meningitidis 
strains.
Recommendations for Healthcare Providers
Healthcare Providers:
Could consider antimicrobial prophylaxis for the duration of eculizumab therapy to potentially reduce the risk of meningococcal disease.
Should continue meningococcal vaccination of all patients who receive eculizumab.
Should administer meningococcal vaccines at least 2 weeks prior to administering the first dose of eculizumab, unless the risks of delaying eculizumab therapy outweigh the risks of developing a meningococcal infection, according to the product label.
Should maintain a high index of suspicion for meningococcal disease in patients taking eculizumab who present with any symptoms consistent with either meningitis or meningococcemia, even if the patient’s symptoms initially appear mild, and irrespective of the patient’s meningococcal vaccine or antimicrobial prophylaxis status.","['https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/clinical/eculizumab.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-indications.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/adult-conditions.html']"

Summary
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a safety communication warning about the use of Magellan Diagnostics’ LeadCare® analyzers (LeadCare, LeadCare II, LeadCare Ultra and LeadCare Plus) with venous blood samples because they might result in falsely low test results. FDA is now advising that Magellan Diagnostics’ LeadCare® analyzers should no longer be used with venous blood samples. The safety alert does not apply to capillary blood lead test results collected by fingerstick or heelstick. The purpose of this Health Advisory is to notify state and local health departments, healthcare providers, and laboratories about CDC’s re-testing guidance in light of the safety alert.
Background
CDC was contacted on April 24, 2017 by FDA requesting assistance in assessing the potential public health risk of a negative bias associated with Magellan’s lead testing systems. FDA is now warning that Magellan Diagnostics’ LeadCare® analyzers should no longer be used with venous blood samples due to the potential for falsely low test results. Not all blood lead tests are affected. Laboratory tests analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) or graphite furnace atomic spectrometry (GFAAS) (also known as electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry [ETAAS]) are not expected to have resulted in falsely low results. This safety alert applies to venous blood lead tests conducted using Magellan Diagnostics’ LeadCare® analyzers whether the patient is a child or an adult. At this time, the safety alert does not apply to capillary blood lead test results collected by fingerstick or heelstick using Magellan Diagnostics’ LeadCare® analyzers. Children are particularly vulnerable to lead exposure due to the effect on their developing brains and organ systems. CDC is working with public health officials throughout the United States to determine where the analyzers were used and which blood lead test results might be affected.
Recommendations
CDC recommends that healthcare providers re-test patients who:
1) are younger than 6 years (72 months) of age at the time of the alert (May 17, 2017) and
 2) had a venous blood lead test result of less than 10 micrograms per deciliter (µg/dL) analyzed using a Magellan Diagnostics’ LeadCare® analyzer at an onsite (e.g., healthcare facility) or at an offsite laboratory.
CDC also recommends that healthcare providers re-test currently pregnant or lactating women who had a venous blood lead test performed using a Magellan Diagnostics’ LeadCare® analyzer.
CDC recommends parents discuss re-testing with their healthcare provider or health department to determine if their child’s blood should be re-tested.
If re-testing indicates blood lead levels in excess of the CDC reference level (
www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/acclpp/blood_lead_levels.htm
), or the state or local action level, the healthcare provider or public health official should refer to CDC and/or local guidelines for appropriate follow-up action (
www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/acclpp/actions_blls.html
).
Re-tests are not recommended if the provider is certain that analyzers other than those described by this Health Advisory were used to analyze the venous blood samples.
For future blood lead testing, healthcare providers and public health officials should:
Send venous samples to Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-compliant laboratories using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) or graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS) (also known as electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry [ETAAS]) instruments.
Send capillary samples to CLIA-compliant laboratories using any CLIA compliant analyzer including ICP-MS, GFAAS, or LeadCare® analyzers.

 CDCHAN-00402
Summary
In July 2016, CDC issued Interim Guidance for Health Care Providers Caring for Pregnant Women with Possible Zika Virus Exposure – United States, July 2016 (
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6529e1.htm
) that includes Zika virus immunoglobulin M (IgM) testing of pregnant women. However, some flavivirus infections can result in prolonged IgM responses (>12 weeks) that make it difficult to determine the timing of infection, especially in testing of asymptomatic people. Emerging epidemiologic and laboratory data indicate that Zika virus IgM can persist beyond 12 weeks in a subset of infected people. Therefore, detection of IgM may not always indicate a recent infection. Although IgM persistence could affect IgM test interpretation for all infected people, it would have the greatest effect on clinical management of pregnant women with a history of living in or traveling to areas with Zika virus transmission before conception. Pregnant women who test positive for IgM antibody may have been infected with Zika virus and developed an IgM response before conception.
For asymptomatic pregnant women living in or frequently traveling to areas with Zika virus transmission, Zika virus nucleic acid test (NAT) testing at least once per trimester should be considered, in addition to IgM testing as previously recommended. If positive, this may provide a more definitive diagnosis of recent Zika infection. However, a negative NAT does not rule out recent infection because viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) declines over time. Other diagnostic methods, such as NAT testing of amniocentesis specimens or serial ultrasounds, may provide additional information to help determine whether the IgM test results suggest a recent infection. Providers should counsel women on the limitations of all tests. In addition, providers may wish to consider IgM testing as part of pre-conception counseling to establish baseline IgM results before pregnancy; however, preconception negative IgM results might have limited value for women at ongoing risk of Zika infection. NAT testing should be performed for any pregnant woman who becomes symptomatic or who has a sexual partner who tests positive for Zika virus infection.
Recommendations
For 
asymptomatic
 pregnant women living in or frequently traveling to areas with Zika virus transmission with posted CDC Zika Travel Notices (
https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/zika-information
), CDC recommends that healthcare providers take these steps:
Screen pregnant women for risk of Zika exposure and symptoms of Zika. Promptly test pregnant women with NAT if they become symptomatic during their pregnancy or if a sexual partner tests positive for Zika virus infection.
Consider NAT testing at least once per trimester, unless a previous test has been positive.*
Consider NAT testing of amniocentesis specimens if amniocentesis is performed for other reasons.

 CDCHAN-00401  
Summary
This Health Advisory describes the identification of emerging 
Shigella
 strains with elevated minimum inhibitory concentration values for ciprofloxacin and outlines new recommendations for clinical diagnosis, management, and reporting, as well as new recommendations for laboratories and public health officials. Current interpretive criteria provided by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) categorize these strains as susceptible to ciprofloxacin, which is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic and a key agent in the management of 
Shigella
 infections.
However, recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state and local public health partners show that these strains often have a quinolone resistance gene that may lead to clinically significant reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolone antibiotics. Clinicians treating patients with multidrug-resistant shigellosis for whom antibiotic treatment is indicated should avoid prescribing fluoroquinolones if the ciprofloxacin MIC is 0.12 μg/mL or higher even if the laboratory report identifies the isolate as susceptible, and should work closely with their clinical microbiology laboratory and infectious disease specialists to determine appropriate antimicrobial therapy.
Shigellosis is a nationally notifiable condition, and all cases of shigellosis should be reported to local health departments.
Background
CDC has identified an increase in 
Shigella
 isolates in the United States with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 0.12–1 μg/mL for the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin. Preliminary data suggest that all 
Shigella
 isolates with ciprofloxacin MICs in this range for which results are available harbor at least one quinolone resistance gene known to confer reduced susceptibility in enteric bacteria.  Shigella isolates without a quinolone resistance gene typically have a ciprofloxacin MIC of ≤0.015 μg/mL. Current CLSI criteria
 
categorize
 Shigella
 isolates with a ciprofloxacin MIC of ≤1 μg/mL as susceptible to ciprofloxacin (1).
CDC does not yet know whether fluoroquinolone treatment of a 
Shigella
 infection with a ciprofloxacin MIC of 0.12–1 μg/mL is associated with a worse clinical outcome for the patient or if such treatment increases the risk of transmission to other individuals. In 
Salmonella 
isolates, ciprofloxacin MICs of 0.12–1 μg/mL have been associated with reduced susceptibility, prolonged clinical illness, and treatment failures and are now categorized by CLSI as intermediate or resistant to ciprofloxacin in 
Salmonella
 species.
Fluoroquinolone resistance is of particular concern given that data from the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System indicate that many 
Shigella
 isolates with a quinolone resistance gene also are resistant to many other commonly used treatment agents, such as azithromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, and ampicillin. This susceptibility profile may encourage clinicians to prescribe fluoroquinolone antibiotics to patients who require treatment.
Rising fluoroquinolone MIC values among 
Shigella
 isolates may be related to the emergence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes in 
Shigella
 species in the United States. 
Shigella
 strains harboring PMQR genes were identified earlier this year following whole genome sequencing of isolates from a multistate outbreak of multidrug-resistant 
Shigella
 
flexneri 
infections predominantly affecting adult men, many of whom identify as men who have sex with men, according to epidemiologic data collected by CDC’s 
Shigella
 program as part of outbreak response. PMQR genes have also been identified in sporadic cases of 
Shigella
 
sonnei
. Plasmid-mediated resistance genes are of particular concern because of their ability to spread between bacteria and their ability to promote chromosomal mutations conferring quinolone resistance, potentially resulting in rapid spread of fluoroquinolone resistance within or between populations of bacteria. The prevalence of PMQR genes among all U.S. 
Shigella
 isolates is currently unknown.
Any patient with a 
Shigella
 infection could carry a strain harboring a quinolone resistance gene with a ciprofloxacin MIC of 0.12–1 μg/mL.
The emergence of 
Shigella
 species with ciprofloxacin MICs of 0.12–1 μg/mL and their association with quinolone resistance genes raises the following concerns:
Fluoroquinolone treatment of 
Shigella
 infection with a strain harboring a quinolone resistance gene may be less effective and may increase the risk of a more severe clinical course for the individual (e.g., increased duration or severity of symptoms, increased need for hospitalization or admission to an intensive care unit, increased length of hospitalization, or increased risk of death).
Fluoroquinolone treatment of 
Shigella
 infection with a strain harboring a quinolone resistance gene also may increase the risk of secondary cases, if the treatment prolongs the duration or increases the quantity of organisms shed in the stool, given the very low infectious dose required for transmission of 
Shigella 
bacteria
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CLINICIANS
Diagnosis
Order stool culture for patients suspected of having a 
Shigella
 infection to obtain isolates for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
Culture-independent diagnostic testing does not provide an isolate and therefore cannot be used to assess susceptibility.
Order antimicrobial susceptibility testing when ordering stool culture for 
Shigella.
When antimicrobial susceptibility testing is performed by broth microdilution, request ciprofloxacin testing that includes dilutions of 0.12 μg/mL or lower.
Even when treatment is not indicated, identifying patients with drug-resistant infections (i.e., ordering susceptibility testing) will help to inform public health management, such as when to return to work, school, and group settings.
Management
Do not routinely prescribe antibiotic therapy for 
Shigella
 infection. Instead, reserve antibiotic therapy
 
for patients for whom it is clinically indicated or when public health officials advise treatment in an outbreak setting. 
Shigellosis is generally a self-limited infection lasting 5-7 days.
Unnecessary treatment with antibiotics promotes resistance.
Treatment can shorten the duration of some illnesses, though typically only by 1-2 days.
Empiric treatment with an antibiotic to which the organism is resistant may worsen symptoms or prolong the duration of shedding of the organism.
If empiric treatment is clinically indicated before antimicrobial susceptibility results are available, refer to recent hospital, clinical laboratory, or public health agency antibiograms.
Antibiotic treatment is recommended for patients who are immunocompromised or who develop severe illness (e.g., patients requiring hospitalization, those with invasive disease, or those with complications).
Local or state health officials may advise antibiotic treatment to mitigate or prevent outbreaks in certain settings (e.g., childcare, food handling).
When antibiotic treatment is indicated, tailor antibiotic choice to antimicrobial susceptibility results as soon as possible with special attention given to the MIC for fluoroquinolone antibiotics.
Avoid prescribing fluoroquinolones if the ciprofloxacin MIC is 0.12 μg/mL or higher even if the laboratory report identifies the isolate as susceptible.
Know the potential risks of fluoroquinolone treatment of 
Shigella
 infections with ciprofloxacin MICs in this range, including possible treatment failure and increased risk of secondary transmission.
The interpretation of MIC values varies for the different fluoroquinolone antibiotics; if susceptibility results are reported for a fluoroquinolone other than ciprofloxacin, contact the microbiology laboratory for assistance with interpretation.
If MIC values are not reported to the clinician with susceptibility results, consider contacting the microbiology laboratory where the susceptibility testing was performed to determine the ciprofloxacin MIC value before treating a patient with a fluoroquinolone agent. Some susceptibility testing methods do not produce a MIC value; the impact of a quinolone resistance gene on test results by other methods (e.g., disk diffusion) is not yet known.
Consult an infectious disease specialist for cases where the 
Shigella
 isolate is resistant to multiple antibiotics and appropriate treatment is unclear.
Obtain follow-up stool cultures
 
in shigellosis patients who have continued or worsening symptoms despite antibiotic therapy.
Consult your local or state health department for guidance on when patients may return to childcare, school, or work.
Counsel patients with active diarrhea on how they can prevent spreading the infection to others, regardless of whether antibiotic treatment is prescribed.
Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet, after handling a soiled diaper, and before eating.
Avoid preparing food for others, when possible.
Children with active diarrhea should not attend childcare, school, or group activities while they are ill.
Wait to have sex (vaginal, anal, and oral) for two weeks after you no longer have diarrhea. Use safe sex practices for several weeks after resuming sex, because 
Shigella
 bacteria may still be in stool for several weeks. 
Reporting
Shigellosis is a nationally notifiable condition. Report all cases of shigellosis to your local health department.
Clinicians who identify a patient with shigellosis and a ciprofloxacin MIC of 0.12–1 μg/mL should include this finding along with other information regarding the case to their local health department to facilitate further testing of the isolate.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR LABORATORIES
Know that a 
Shigella 
isolate with a ciprofloxacin MIC of 0.12–1 μg/mL may be associated with the presence of a quinolone resistance gene.
Test 
Shigella
 isolates using susceptibility panels that include 0.12, 0.25, and 0.5 μg/mL dilutions for ciprofloxacin, when using a commercially available automated system (such as BD Phoenix, MicroScan, Vitek 2, or similar system) for susceptibility testing.
Include MIC values for fluoroquinolone agents in the susceptibility testing report for 
Shigella 
isolates.
Report all findings of strains of 
Shigella
 with a ciprofloxacin MIC of 0.12–1 μg/mL to the state public health laboratory, and submit isolates to it to facilitate further phenotypic and genetic testing.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS
Know that a 
Shigella 
isolate with a ciprofloxacin MIC of 0.12–1 μg/mL may be associated with the presence of a quinolone resistance gene.
Contact CDC at 
EntericBacteria@cdc.gov
 if you receive reports of patients with 
Shigella 
infection and possible fluoroquinolone treatment failure.
Submit 
Shigella
 isolates with a ciprofloxacin MIC of 0.12–1 μg/mL to the state public health laboratory for whole genome sequencing, if possible. If the state laboratory does not have capacity to sequence the isolate, please notify CDC at 
EntericBacteria@cdc.gov
What CDC is Doing
CDC is working with state and local public health departments and clinical partners to investigate if clinical outcomes are worse for patients infected with 
Shigella
 strains harboring a quinolone resistance gene who receive ciprofloxacin treatment.
CDC has notified representatives at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and CLSI, who will review CDC’s findings to determine whether a change to the susceptible range of MIC values for ciprofloxacin in 
Shigella
 is warranted.
CDC will continue to monitor trends in antimicrobial susceptibility of 
Shigella 
isolates and will perform genetic testing on select strains with ciprofloxacin MICs of 0.12–1 μg/mL or higher to confirm the presence and type of quinolone resistance genes.","['https://www.cdc.gov/shigella/resources.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/shigella/prevention-control.html']"

Summary
CDC and health officials from Wisconsin and Illinois are conducting an investigation of Seoul virus infections among pet rats and persons exposed to rats at rat-breeding facilities in Wisconsin and Illinois. Seoul virus is a member of the hantavirus group of rodent-borne viruses. Trace-back and trace-out investigations of possibly infected rodents have identified distribution chains in other states that may require additional investigations. People who become infected with this virus often exhibit relatively mild or no symptoms, but some will develop a form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) with death in approximately 1–2% of HFRS cases. Although serologic studies have indicated the presence of Seoul virus in wild rats in the United States, this is the first known outbreak associated with pet rats in the United States.
As part of the outbreak investigation, CDC and Illinois and Wisconsin health officials are conducting trace-back and trace-out investigations to determine where rodents from confirmed-positive facilities may have been distributed.
CDC currently recommends testing of all persons who report recent or current illness after (1) handling rats from a facility with Seoul virus infection that was confirmed by laboratory testing (either rat or human), or (2) handling rats from a facility that sold rats to a facility with Seoul virus infection. Testing is also offered to persons without illness but (1) who are reporting exposure to rats from a facility with Seoul virus infection that was confirmed by laboratory testing, or (2) who are reporting exposure to rats from a facility that sold rats to a facility with Seoul virus infection but where no illness has been reported.
In general, CDC recommends consideration of hantavirus testing in all persons with symptoms of Seoul virus infection and rat contact, even if the rat was not associated with a facility where a confirmed infection in a rat or human was reported.
In the United States, hantavirus infections in people are notifiable conditions. Healthcare providers who suspect hantavirus infection in a patient should contact their state or local health department.
Background
During early December 2016, a home-based rat breeder in Wisconsin developed an acute febrile illness. During late December 2016, CDC tested a blood specimen from the patient and confirmed that the infection was caused by Seoul virus, a member of the hantavirus family of rodent-borne viruses. A family member who worked with rodents also tested positive for Seoul virus. Both people have recovered. A follow-up investigation of rat breeders who supplied the initial patient’s rats revealed six additional human cases of Seoul virus infections occurring at two Illinois rat-breeding facilities. Of the eight confirmed cases in Wisconsin and Illinois, two were hospitalized. Rats at these facilities have also tested positive for Seoul virus. 
Human and animal health officials are working together to trace-back from where infected rodents may have come, and trace-out where potentially infected rodents may have been distributed, and make sure infected rats are not distributed further. Persons at risk of Seoul virus infection due to exposure to infected rats are also being identified. To date, state health officials in Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, and Wisconsin have been notified that their residents may have infected rats.
Seoul virus is transmitted from rats to people. People who become infected with this virus often exhibit relatively mild or no symptoms, but some develop HFRS (
https://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/hfrs
), which can result in death in approximately 1–2% of HFRS cases. Symptoms include fever, severe headache, back and abdominal pain, chills, blurred vision, redness of the eyes, or rash. HFRS is characterized by a prodromal phase with non-specific symptoms and can progress to hypotension, decreased urine output, and renal failure, which often resolves after a diuretic phase. Coagulopathy and pulmonary edema are rare complications. Laboratory findings include low platelets, elevated white blood cell counts, electrolyte abnormalities, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine, and proteinuria.
People can become infected after exposure to aerosolized urine, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents or after exposure to dust from their nests or bedding. Transmission may also occur from rat bites or when contaminated materials are directly introduced into broken skin or onto mucous membranes. The incubation period for humans ranges from 1 to 8 weeks; however, most individuals develop symptoms 1 to 2 weeks after exposure. Seoul virus is not spread from human to human. Infected rats do not become sick but can shed virus for many months.
Seoul virus infection in humans is confirmed by testing for Seoul virus IgM and IgG antibodies or by detection of viral RNA. IgM is commonly detectable within a few days after symptom onset and is detectable for approximately 2 to 3 months. IgG can usually be detected within a week after symptom onset and can remain detectable for years. Viral RNA is often detectable in blood from patients with acute disease. In coordination with state health departments, CDC offers testing for patients suspected of having Seoul virus infection.
There is no specific treatment for Seoul virus infection. Individuals with acute disease should have blood values monitored with laboratory testing, including complete blood count, basic metabolic profile, liver enzymes, and urinalysis. Supportive therapy is a mainstay of care. Care includes careful management of the patient’s hydration, renal function, and electrolyte levels; care also includes maintenance of correct oxygen and blood pressure levels and appropriate treatment of any secondary infections. Dialysis may be required to correct severe fluid overload. Intravenous ribavirin is an investigational drug that can be available on an emergency use basis for severe disease (
http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/ApprovalApplications/InvestigationalNewDrugINDApplication/ucm090039.htm
External
).
Recommendations
CDC currently recommends laboratory testing for all persons who report recent or current illness after (1) handling rats from a facility with Seoul virus infection that was confirmed by laboratory testing (either rat or human), or (2) handling rats from a facility that sold rats to a facility with Seoul virus infection. Testing is also offered to persons with exposure to rats from a facility with Seoul virus infection that was confirmed by laboratory testing, or to persons with exposure to rats from a facility that sold rats to a facility with Seoul virus infection but where no illness was reported. All testing should be coordinated with the healthcare provider’s local or state health department.
Persons with potentially infected rats should not sell, trade, or release their rats. They should contact their state health department with any questions. Healthcare providers should emphasize the importance of safe animal practices with their patients (
https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/pets/small-mammals/petrodents.html
).
Health care providers may also consider laboratory testing of patients with symptoms suggestive of Seoul virus infection and a history of rat contact, regardless of whether there is known interaction with rats or rat facilities with laboratory confirmed Seoul virus infections. 
As with all human hantavirus infections, Seoul virus infection is a notifiable disease. Healthcare providers who suspect Seoul virus infection in a patient should report it to their local health department.
For laboratory testing inquiries, healthcare providers should contact their state or local health department. Prior approval is required by the state health department.","['https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/pets/small-mammals/petrodents.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/outbreaks/seoul-virus/faqs.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/pets/small-mammals/petrodents.html']"

Summary
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is providing information on: 1) the current status of a multistate outbreak of coagulopathy from exposure to synthetic cannabinoid products containing a vitamin K-epoxide cycle antagonist, brodifacoum; 2) the emergence of 2 new clinical scenarios; and 3) recommendations to help clinicians make decisions related to these 2 new clinical scenarios.
This is an update to the Health Alert Network (HAN) advisory released on May 25, 2018 titled 
Outbreak of
 
Life-threatening Coagulopathy Associated with Synthetic Cannabinoids Use
 (
https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/han00410.asp
).
Outbreak Update
Since the index patient with hypocoagulopathy associated with synthetic cannabinoids use was identified on March 8, 2018 in Illinois, at least 324 people have presented to healthcare facilities with serious bleeding from possible exposure. The largest number of patients were in Illinois (164), followed by Wisconsin (86), Maryland (44), Florida (6), Pennsylvania (6), Missouri (5), North Carolina (5), Indiana (5), Kentucky (1), Virginia (1), and West Virginia (1). Laboratory investigation confirmed brodifacoum exposure in at least 150 patients. There have been at least eight (8) fatalities. Vitamin K1 continues to be the recommended therapy. Since the original HAN advisory on May 25, 2018, two (2) new clinical scenarios have emerged:
Several patients have outpatient follow-up blood brodifacoum concentrations that are higher than their initial blood brodifacoum concentrations.
At least one patient has become pregnant since starting outpatient oral Vitamin K1 treatment.
When patients are found to have outpatient follow-up blood brodifacoum concentrations higher than their initial blood brodifacoum concentrations, it strongly suggests that they have continued or resumed using synthetic cannabinoid products containing brodifacoum while on oral vitamin K1 therapy. The consequences of re-exposure to brodifacoum include:
Risk of life-threatening hemorrhage,
Oral vitamin K1 dosing may need to be increased, and
Oral vitamin K1 treatment duration may need to be extended.
Pregnancies in patients who are on oral vitamin K1 treatment for brodifacoum toxicity are high-risk pregnancies. Brodifacoum crosses the placenta. Both mother and fetus are at risk for serious bleeding. Brodifacoum may also be a teratogen because its chemical structure is similar to warfarin, a known teratogen.
Recommendations for Clinicians
Maintain a high index of suspicion for continued or resumed use of synthetic cannabinoid products containing brodifacoum in patients who are on oral vitamin K1 therapy. Ask these patients about continued or resumed use of synthetic cannabinoid products.
Counsel against resuming or continuing use of synthetic cannabinoid products. Refer patients to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) national helpline, 1-800-662-HELP(4357), a free, confidential, 24/7, 365-day-a-year treatment referral and information service in English and Spanish for individuals and families facing mental and/or substance use disorders; substance abuse counseling is also available.
Advise patients that their current oral vitamin K1 dosing may not prevent recurrent coagulopathy from re-exposure to brodifacoum in synthetic cannabinoid products and the duration of oral vitamin K1 treatment may need to be extended.
Consider periodic quantitative testing of patients’ blood for brodifacoum during outpatient follow-up visits to inform if patients continued or resumed use of synthetic cannabinoid products containing brodifacoum. In addition, serial blood brodifacoum concentrations allow for calculation of blood brodifacoum half-life and assist in determining duration of oral vitamin K1 therapy.
Ask all women of childbearing age who are on oral vitamin K1 therapy about the possibility of being pregnant and counsel them about reliable contraceptive techniques. A periodic pregnancy test should be performed on all women of childbearing age who are on oral vitamin K1 therapy. Pregnant patients on oral vitamin K1 should be referred for high-risk pregnancy management and follow-up.
Contact your local poison control center (1-800-222-1222) for questions on diagnostic testing and management of these patients.
Promptly report possible cases to your local or state health department.
Recommendations for the Public
CDC recommends that people do not use synthetic cannabinoid products. Synthetic cannabinoid products are always dangerous because it is impossible for people to know what chemicals are in the product, how much they are being exposed to, and how their body will react to the chemicals. The synthetic cannabinoid products associated with this outbreak are especially dangerous because they contain brodifacoum, a chemical used as rat poison that can cause uncontrolled bleeding.
People who have used synthetic cannabinoid products in the past three months and are concerned about their health should contact their healthcare provider. Synthetic cannabinoid products users who develop any unusual bruising or bleeding should immediately seek medical attention.
People who are currently on oral vitamin K1 treatment for brodifacoum poisoning should not use synthetic cannabinoid products, as this can cause new or worsening bleeding and may prolong the course of vitamin K1 treatment. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) national helpline, 1-800-662-HELP(4357), is a free, confidential, 24/7, 365-day-a-year treatment referral and information service in English and Spanish for individuals and families facing mental and/or substance use disorders.
Women who are currently on oral vitamin K1 treatment for brodifacoum poisoning should use an effective contraceptive method to prevent pregnancy while being treated. .","['https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/hsb/chemicals/sc/default.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/hsb/chemicals/sc/healthcare.html']"

Summary
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is reminding clinicians seeing patients from the areas affected by Hurricane Florence to maintain a high index of suspicion for CO poisoning. Other people who may be exposed to the same CO source may need to be identified and assessed.
The signs and symptoms of CO exposure are variable and nonspecific. A tension-type headache is the most common symptom of mild CO poisoning. Other symptoms may include dizziness, flu-like symptoms without a fever, drowsiness, chest pain, and altered mental status.
Clinical manifestations of severe CO poisoning include tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, metabolic acidosis, dysrhythmias, myocardial ischemia or infarction, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, neurologic findings including irritability, impaired memory, cognitive and sensory disturbances, ataxia, altered or loss of consciousness, seizures, coma, and death, although any organ system might be involved.
Although CO poisoning can be fatal to anyone, children, pregnant women, the unborn, persons with sickle cell disease, older adults, and persons with chronic illness (e.g., heart or lung disease) are particularly vulnerable.
Background
High winds and heavy rain from Hurricane Florence began affecting the southeastern U.S. around September 12, 2018. Impact on the southeast coast and inland led to thousands of people without power.  Those without power may turn to alternate power sources such as gasoline generators and may use propane or charcoal grills for cooking. If used or placed improperly, these sources can lead to CO build up inside buildings, garages, or campers and poison the people and animals inside.
With a focused history of patient activities and health symptoms, exposure to a CO source may become apparent. Appropriate and prompt diagnostic testing and treatment are crucial to reduce morbidity and prevent mortality from CO poisoning. Identifying and mitigating the CO source is critical in preventing other poisoning cases.
Recommendations for Clinicians
Consider CO poisoning in patients affected by Hurricane Florence, particularly those in areas currently without power. Assess symptoms and recent patient activities that point to likely CO exposure. Evaluation should also include examination for other conditions, including smoke inhalation, trauma, medical illness, or intoxication.
Administer 100% oxygen until the patient is symptom-free or until a diagnosis of CO poisoning has been ruled out.","['https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/co_guidance.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/co_guidance.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/co_guidance.html']"

CDCHAN-00414
Summary

The Israeli Ministry of Health is reporting an outbreak of leptospirosis in persons with exposure to natural water sources in the Golan Heights region of northern Israel after July 1, 2018. As of September 6, 2018, three persons with leptospirosis who traveled to Israel have been identified in the United States, with additional suspected cases reported and under investigation. Early symptoms of leptospirosis include fever, headache, chills, muscle aches, vomiting, diarrhea, cough, conjunctival suffusion (conjunctival redness without exudates), jaundice, and sometimes a rash. Clinicians should consider leptospirosis as a diagnosis in any patient who develops an acute febrile illness within 4 weeks of travel to one of the areas in northern Israel listed below since July 1, 2018.
Background

Seven recreational water sites in the Golan Heights region have been linked to the outbreak:
Gilabun (Jilbon)
Yarden (Jordan) Park
Majrase (Majrase-Beteha Nature Reserve)
Meshushim (Meshushim Nature Reserve)
Yehudiya (Yehudia Nature Reserve)
Zaki (Zakhi)
Zavitan
Leptospira 
species are spread by the urine of infected animals and can survive for weeks to months in fresh water, soil, and mud. The incubation period is usually 5-14 days, with a range of 2-30 days. Humans acquire the disease through direct contact with urine from animals infected with leptospirosis or with urine-contaminated water or mud. High-risk activities can include wading, swimming, or boating in floodwater or freshwater (rivers, streams, lakes) that may be contaminated with animal urine. Some actions like prolonged immersion in, submerging head in, or swallowing contaminated water can particularly increase risk. Other high risk activities can include direct contact with animals and activities that can lead to skin abrasions and water or soil exposure. Human-to-human transmission is very rare but has been documented through sexual intercourse and breastfeeding. Transmission has also rarely occurred through animal bites.
In humans, leptospirosis can cause a wide range of symptoms. Most patients have a mild flu-like illness with symptoms including fever, headache, muscle aches, conjunctival suffusion, vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, and sometimes a rash. Some patients may go on to develop severe illness, including liver and renal failure, hemorrhage (especially pulmonary), aseptic meningitis, cardiac arrhythmias, and pulmonary insufficiency. Leptospirosis is fatal in approximately 5-15% of patients with severe illness.
Recommendations

Clinicians should evaluate patients for leptospirosis who have onset of an acute febrile illness within 4 weeks of travel to the Golan Heights region in northern Israel, especially with exposure to one of the seven natural water recreational sites listed above. If clinicians suspect leptospirosis in a patient, they should initiate treatment with antibiotics (e.g., doxycycline or penicillin) prior to receiving results of diagnostic tests, as earlier treatment is associated with a decrease in duration and severity of disease. For more specifics about antibiotics and dosage, please see CDC’s 
leptospirosis fact sheet for clinicians
Cdc-pdf
Commercially available tests include:
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR): a positive result is confirmatory, but a negative result does not rule out leptospirosis.

In the acute phase of illness, leptospires are present in the blood (septicemia) for approximately the first 4–6 days of illness. Leptospires may be shed intermittently in the urine after approximately the first week of illness onset.
Screening (non-confirmatory) IgM-based serologic assays (ELISA, ImmunoDot): serologic test results may be falsely negative early in the course of the disease.

Antibodies to leptospires develop between 3-10 days after symptom onset, thus any serologic test must be interpreted accordingly. Negative serologic test results from samples collected in the first week of illness do not rule out disease. Repeat serologic testing on convalescent-phase samples collected 7-14 days after the first testing.
Samples can be sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for confirmatory testing (PCR and confirmatory serologic testing by the microscopic agglutination test). Send all specimens through the state/territorial public health department, unless authorized to send directly to CDC. Specimen submission instructions are available at CDC’s Zoonoses and Select Agent Laboratory website (
https://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dhcpp/bacterial_special/zoonoses_lab.html
).
It is best to submit as many specimen types as possible (both in terms of type of body fluid and collection date within illness progression). Recommended specimens based on collection timing:
Acute-phase illness (first week): whole blood and serum

CDCHAN00413,"Rising Numbers of Deaths Involving Fentanyl and Fentanyl Analogs, Including Carfentanil, and Increased Usage and Mixing with Non-opioids",https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/han00413.asp,Health Update,"July 11, 2018, 1300 ET (1:00 PM ET)","
Summary 
This Health Alert Network (HAN) Update is to alert public health departments, health care professionals, first responders, and medical examiners and coroners to important new developments in the evolving opioid overdose epidemic, which increasingly involves illicitly manufactured fentanyl and an array of potent fentanyl analogs (i.e., compounds that are chemically related to fentanyl). It is the second update to the original health advisory, 
HAN 384
, issued October 26, 2015, which alerted the public to the increase in unintentional overdose fatalities involving fentanyl in multiple states, primarily driven by illicitly manufactured fentanyl. The first update to this health advisory was released on August 25, 2016 (
HAN 395
), describing the sharp increase in the availability of counterfeit pills containing varying amounts of fentanyl and fentanyl analogs, the continued increase of overdose deaths involving fentanyl across a growing number of states, and the widening array of fentanyl analogs being mixed with heroin or sold as heroin.
The current update includes information on: (1) the continued increase in the supply of fentanyl and fentanyl analogs detected by law enforcement; (2) the sharp rise in overdose deaths involving fentanyl and fentanyl analogs in a growing number of states, in particular the growing number of deaths involving the ultra-high potency fentanyl analog known as carfentanil; (3) the expanding number of poly-drug combinations implicated in opioid overdose deaths, which include non-opioids, such as cocaine; (4) the updated comprehensive guidance available to law enforcement and other emergency responders to prevent occupational exposure to fentanyl and fentanyl analogs; and (5) updated recommendations for public health professionals and health care providers regarding prevention and response efforts.
Background
The supply, distribution, and potency of illicitly manufactured fentanyl and fentanyl analogs in the U.S. drug market is continuously evolving. The Drug Enforcement Administration’s (DEA) National Forensic Laboratory Information System (NFLIS), which systematically collects drug identification results from drug cases submitted for analysis to forensic laboratories (referred to as drug submissions), estimated that drug submissions testing positive for fentanyl more than doubled from 2015 to 2016, rising from 14,440 to 34,119. This increase continued into 2017, with an estimated 25,460 reports in the first six months of 2017 alone [1,2,3]. In 2016, states reporting the highest number of fentanyl drug submissions remained concentrated in the East and Midwest, with all being located east of the Mississippi River, or bordering the Mississippi River. This geographic clustering of states is believed to be related to the supply chains of the white powder heroin market, which predominates east of the Mississippi [10]. Illicitly manufactured fentanyl powder can be readily mixed with white powder heroin or mimic this form of heroin, while black tar heroin, which is primarily sold west of the Mississippi, is more difficult to blend with fentanyl powder.
During January–June, 2017, NFLIS received an increased number of reports from state and local forensic laboratories of fentanyl analogs and other synthetic illicit opioids (e.g., U-47700, described below) detected among drug submissions. This included two extremely potent fentanyl analogs, carfentanil and 3-methylfentanyl, which are 100 and 4 times more potent than fentanyl, respectively [4]. Carfentanil drug submissions reported to NFLIS rapidly increased from an estimated 1,251 in 2016 to 2,268 during the first six months of 2017 (see table below) [2, 3]. In 2016, a total of 11 states reported carfentanil drug submissions, including Ohio with more than 900 reports and Florida with more than 100 reports. The other 9 states each submitted between 1 and 49 carfentanil reports [3]. Further spread is expected as new states report overdose deaths related to carfentanil in 2017. Other fentanyl analogs rising in prominence during 2016-17 are 3-methylfentanyl, furanylfentanyl, and acrylfentanyl (see table below) [2, 3].  Finally, drug submissions testing positive for a synthetic illicit opioid known as U-47700, first encountered by the DEA in 2016, increased from 533 submissions in 2016 to 1,087 during January–June, 2017 [1,2]. This newly emerging illicit opioid was temporarily placed under Schedule I control under the Controlled Substances Act in October 2016, allowing for criminal prosecution of those who possess, import, distribute, or manufacture it.

The dramatic rise in the supply of illicitly manufactured fentanyl and fentanyl analogs has been mirrored by an equally dramatic rise in deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone, a category which includes fentanyl and fentanyl analogs. The rate of synthetic opioid overdose deaths in the U.S. rose from 3.1 to 6.2 deaths per 100,000 between 2015 and 2016, marking the first year that synthetic opioids became the most common type of opioid involved in all opioid overdose deaths [5]. This trend has extended into 2017, with preliminary counts from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) indicating that more than 55% of opioid overdose deaths occurring nationally in the 12-months ending November 2017 involved synthetic opioids, accounting for more than 27,000 overdose deaths [6]. This 12-month sum of synthetic opioid overdose deaths exceeds the total number of all opioid overdose deaths in 2013, when deaths involving synthetic opioids first began to climb.
Enhanced surveillance of opioid overdose deaths has been initiated in a growing number of states under a system that CDC funds known as the State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System (SUDORS). This surveillance system is capable of identifying the specific fentanyl compounds involved in opioid overdose deaths [7]. In the 10 states (KY, ME, MA, NH, NM, OH, OK, RI, WV, and WI) reporting preliminary data for the period July 2016–June 2017, 7 states reported that 50% or more of all opioid overdose deaths tested positive for fentanyl, and 5 of the 10 states reported that 10% or more opioid overdose deaths tested positive for fentanyl analogs. The number of opioid overdose deaths testing positive for fentanyl or fentanyl analogs in these 10 states substantially increased from the second half of 2016 to the first half of 2017, with total fentanyl involved deaths rising from 2,986 to 3,303, and fentanyl analog involved deaths rising from 764 to 1,511. Notably, carfentanil deaths nearly doubled from 421 in the last half of 2016 to 815 in the first half of 2017, and became the most commonly detected fentanyl analog overall during this period in the 10 states reporting (1,236 deaths, 11% of all opioid deaths).
The next most commonly detected fentanyl analogs during July 2016–June 2017 in the 10 states were furanylfentanyl (518 deaths, 5% of all opioid deaths), acrylfentanyl (334 deaths, 3% of all opioid deaths), and acetylfentanyl (319 deaths, 3% of all opioid deaths). Ohio alone reported more than 1,700 opioid overdose deaths testing positive for fentanyl analogs during July 2016–June 2017, with more than 1,100 of those deaths involving carfentanil. This represents around 90% of all carfentanil deaths reported in SUDORS during this time period. Florida has also been highly impacted by fentanyl analog overdose deaths, and in particular by carfentanil. Although not funded to report data into SUDORS for the period July 2016–June 2017, Florida independently reported 1,274 fentanyl analog deaths in 2016, with carfentanil being the most commonly detected, involved in 43% of all fentanyl analog deaths (n=552) [8]. Florida and Ohio are also notable for having reported a widening array of fentanyl analogs among their opioid overdose deaths, with Florida detecting 8 different fentanyl analogs in 2016, and Montgomery County, Ohio, detecting 8 different fentanyl analogs and other illicit synthetic opioids in the first two months of 2017 alone [8,9]. Finally, U-47700 was detected in 123 opioid overdose deaths in SUDORS and was widespread across the 10 states reporting, with at least one U-47700 attributable death occurring in 9 of these states.
Recent data from public health and law enforcement has revealed that fentanyl and its analogs are increasingly becoming available on the illicit market mixed with non-opioid drugs, particularly cocaine. In 2016, fentanyl compounds were detected in combination with other non-opioid substances in more than 1,500 drug submissions tested nationally by NFLIS, with over 60% of these involving a combination of fentanyl and cocaine [10]. The DEA released a bulletin in 2017 warning of the widespread adulteration of cocaine with fentanyl and fentanyl analogs in the state of Florida [11], as well as a January 2018 bulletin warning of the rising number of cocaine and fentanyl submissions in Pennsylvania [12]. During the period from 2016 to 2017, 180 cocaine drug submissions tested positive for fentanyl or fentanyl analogs in Florida, including acetyl fentanyl, carfentanil, furanylfentanyl, and p-fluoroisobutyryl fentanyl. In Pennsylvania, cocaine/fentanyl combination drug submissions rose 112% from 2016 to 2017, rising from 63 to 134 drug submissions during that period. In early 2017, health officials in New Haven, Connecticut, reported an outbreak of fentanyl overdoses among a group of opioid-naïve patients (no reported prior use of opioids) who had reported only the use of cocaine prior to being seen in the emergency department (ED) [13]. Three of these cases were fatal, with opioid-naïve persons being particularly vulnerable to the effects of an opioid overdose. Later that year, New York City (NYC) released a health advisory that included a warning to NYC residents that fentanyl was increasingly being detected among persons who overdosed on cocaine in 2016 [14]. It was further noted that The New York Police Department forensic laboratory had identified the presence of fentanyl in benzodiazepines, counterfeit opioid pills, ketamine, and methamphetamine. The DEA has reported limited but rising numbers of seizures of methamphetamine mixed with fentanyl and fentanyl-related compounds, with a total of 23 submissions across 10 states during 2014-2016 [10].
In response to these ongoing threats, CDC will begin providing at least yearly updates on the number of fatal opioid overdoses involving fentanyl and fentanyl analogs starting in 2018 from states participating in SUDORS. SUDORS expanded to 32 states and Washington D.C., in 2017, and is expected to expand further in 2019.
Recommendations
CDC suggests the following actions in response to the increased risk of fentanyl overdose from illicitly manufactured fentanyl due to the widening array of highly toxic fentanyl analogs and the combination of these fentanyl analogs with other non-opioid drugs, including cocaine and benzodiazepines:
 (1) Improve detection of fentanyl outbreaks to facilitate effective response
Public health departments
Explore methods for rapidly identifying drug overdose outbreaks through use of existing surveillance systems such as medical examiner data, emergency medical services data, near-real time emergency department data, and poison center data [15].
Consider engaging local poison centers to assist with treatment of patients (national toll free phone number is 800-222-1222).
Track and monitor geographic trends in the illicit opioid drug supply, including the drugs with which opioids are mixed, using DEA’s National Forensic Laboratory Information System (NFLIS) and National Heroin Threat Assessment Summaries and alerts on the DEA website [16] to inform prevention and response efforts.
Explore other methods for obtaining information on local drug supply, including building partnerships with local laboratories and High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) units in order to receive data in a timelier manner.
Track decedent demographics and known risk factors for overdose (e.g., drug type, recent release from an institution, previous overdose) to inform prevention efforts [17].
Raise awareness among key partners and stakeholders to the widening profile of those at risk for fentanyl overdose, which increasingly includes persons misusing diverted prescribed oral pain and sedative medications [21] and people using cocaine in some states [13,14].
Develop general public health messaging about fentanyl, including fentanyl-laced counterfeit pills and fentanyl analogs that emphasizes the toxicity and potential lethality of the drug versus its high “potency.” The messaging should include warnings of the highly variable content of fentanyl present in illicit products, which further elevates risk of overdose, as well as the potential presence of fentanyl in cocaine [10,11,12,13,14,18]. For further guidance, see information about fentanyl on the CDC website (
https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/opioids/fentanyl.html
Medical examiners and coroners
Screen for fentanyl in suspected opioid overdose cases in regions reporting high levels or sharp increases in fentanyl seizures, fentanyl-related overdose fatalities, or unusually high spikes in heroin or cocaine overdoses with signs of opioid toxidrome, or unspecified drug overdose fatalities.
Screen specimens using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test that can detect fentanyl. Confirmatory 
gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS
) of positive screens for fentanyl may either confirm the presence of fentanyl or suggest the presence of a fentanyl analog. [20]. When fentanyl screening is negative, or confirmatory testing is inconclusive, yet opioid or fentanyl overdose is highly suspected, consider specialized testing for fentanyl analogs, particularly if an increase in overdoses is occurring or fentanyl analogs have been detected in local drug products.
Law enforcement:
Use extreme caution when handling suspected illicitly manufactured fentanyl, white powders, and unknown substances. For further guidance, see newly available CDC recommendations for protecting workers at risk (
https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/fentanyl/risk.html
), as well as “Fentanyl Safety Recommendations for First Responders”, provided by the White House National Security Council (
https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/key-issues/fentanyl
External
Prioritize and expedite laboratory testing of drug samples taken from drug overdose scenes, if possible.
Share data on fentanyl and fentanyl analog drug seizures with local health departments, medical examiners, and coroners.
Carry a supply of naloxone so that it can be administered immediately to mitigate the effects of an overdose. (See Recommendation 2 below.)
Laboratories:
Utilize the following government forensic laboratories supporting law enforcement for assistance with reference materials or reference data on a case-by-case basis:

DEA Reference Materials Program (email: 
DEALabRefMaterials@usdoj.gov
DEA Emerging Trends Program (email: 
DEA.Emerging.Trends@usdoj.gov
Scientific Working Group for the Analysis of Seized Drugs (website: 
swgdrug.org
External
 (2) Expand Use of Naloxone and Opioid Use Disorder Treatment
Health care providers:
Multiple dosages of naloxone may need to be administered per overdose event because of fentanyl and fentanyl analog’s increased potency relative to other opioids. Orally-ingested counterfeit pills laced with fentanyl or fentanyl analogs may require prolonged dosing of naloxone in the ED hospital setting due to a delayed toxicity that has been reported in some cases [19].
Facilitate access to Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT). MAT is a comprehensive approach to address the needs of persons with opioid use disorder and combines the use of medication with counseling and behavioral therapies. Providers should discuss treatment options with persons who have an opioid use disorder and with persons who have experienced an opioid-related overdose once they are stabilized. Access to MAT has been demonstrated to be particularly important in the correctional system setting, where recently released persons are known to be at high risk of overdose due to reduced opioid tolerance [16].
Emergency departments can serve as points of intervention for persons who experience an overdose, and post-overdose protocols, which include prescription of naloxone and connecting patients with case management services or peer navigators to help link them into treatment services are recommended [22].
Harm reduction organizations (e.g., organizations, often community-based, focused on reducing the adverse effects of substance use, including overdose, addiction, and infectious disease)
Expand naloxone access to persons at risk for opioid-related overdose and to their friends and family members [23].Expanded access to naloxone in the correctional setting for those with impending release is important given their elevated risk of overdose upon release [16], and can be best achieved through implementation of naloxone distribution programs that do not require inmates to request special services to receive it [24].
Train those using illicit opioids how to effectively administer naloxone and emphasize the importance of calling 911 immediately after recognizing an overdose because available naloxone may be insufficient in reversing the overdose.
Link persons misusing opioids to treatment or other services to reduce the risk of overdose.","['https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/opioids/fentanyl.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/fentanyl/risk.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6533a2.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6533a3.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6712a1.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6643e1.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6604a4.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6426a3.htm']"
CDCHAN00412,Outbreak of Hepatitis A Virus (HAV) Infections among Persons Who Use Drugs and Persons Experiencing Homelessness,https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/han00412.asp,Health Advisory,"June 11, 2018, 0800 ET (8:00 AM ET)","
Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state health departments are investigating hepatitis A outbreaks in multiple states among persons reporting drug use and/or homelessness and their contacts. This Health Alert Network (HAN) Advisory alerts public health departments, healthcare facilities, and programs providing services to affected populations about these outbreaks of hepatitis A infections and provides guidance to assist in identifying and preventing new infections.
Background

Hepatitis A infection is a vaccine-preventable illness. The primary means of hepatitis A virus (HAV) transmission in the United States is typically person-to-person through the fecal-oral route (i.e., ingestion of something that has been contaminated with the feces of an infected person).
1
 Symptoms include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, clay-colored bowel movements, joint pain, and jaundice. Although rare, atypical extra hepatic manifestations include rash, pancreatitis, renal disease, arthritis, and anemia.
2
 Severe infections can result in cholestatic hepatitis, relapsing hepatitis, and fulminant hepatitis leading to death.
3
 Average incubation of HAV is 28 days, but illness can occur up to 50 days after exposure.
4
 An HAV-infected person can be viremic up to six weeks through their clinical course and excrete virus in stool for up to two weeks prior to becoming symptomatic, making identifying exposures particularly difficult.
5-7
 Illness from hepatitis A is typically acute and self-limited; however, when this disease affects populations with already poor health (e.g., hepatitis B and C infections, chronic liver disease), infection can lead to serious outcomes, including death.
The best way to prevent hepatitis A infection is through vaccination with the hepatitis A vaccine. The number and timing of the doses depends on the type of vaccine administered. Vaccines containing HAV antigen that are currently licensed in the United States are the single-antigen vaccines HAVRIX
®
 (manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline, Rixensart, Belgium) and VAQTA
®
 (manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, New Jersey) and the combination vaccine TWINRIX
®
 (containing both HAV and hepatitis B virus antigens; manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline). All are inactivated vaccines. GamaSTAN S/D (Grifols Therapeutics, Inc., Research Triangle Park, North Carolina) immune globulin (IG) for intramuscular administration is the only IG product approved for HAV prophylaxis. The efficacy of IG or vaccine when administered >2 weeks after exposure has not been established. Additionally, practicing good hand hygiene—including thoroughly washing hands after using the bathroom, changing diapers, and before preparing or eating food—plays an important role in preventing the spread of hepatitis A.
From January 2017 to April 2018, CDC has received more than 2,500 reports of hepatitis A infections associated with person-to-person transmission from multiple states. Of the more than 1,900 reports for which risk factors are known, more than 1,300 (68%) of the infected persons report drug use (injection and non-injection), homelessness, or both.
8-11
 During this time, responses conducted in various states resulted in increased vaccine demand and usage, resulting in constrained supplies of vaccine. As available vaccine supply has increased and progress has been made towards controlling ongoing outbreaks in some jurisdictions, vaccine is more readily available. However, both CDC and vaccine manufacturers continue to closely monitor ongoing demand for adult hepatitis A vaccine in the United States.
During the mid-1980s, drug use was a risk factor for >20% of all hepatitis A cases reported to CDC, but no large outbreaks have occurred among persons who use drugs since adoption of the recommendation for hepatitis A vaccination of persons who use injection and non-injection drugs was made in 1996.
12,13
 Outbreaks of hepatitis A infections among homeless persons have occurred in other countries, but large outbreaks among the homeless have not been described previously in the United States.
14-17
Person-to-person transmission of HAV between persons who report drug use and/or homelessness could result from contaminated needles and other injection paraphernalia, specific sexual contact and practices, or from generally poor sanitary conditions.
13
 Transience, economic instability, limited access to healthcare, distrust of public officials and public messages, and frequent lack of follow-up contact information makes this population difficult to reach for preventive services such as vaccination, use of sterile injection equipment, and case management and contact tracing. These challenges make outbreaks among these groups difficult to control.
Rapid identification, a comprehensive response, and novel public health approaches may be required to address needs unique to these populations. Urgent action is needed to prevent further HAV transmission among these risk groups.
Recommendations for Health Departments
Review the most recent sources of data on hepatitis A diagnoses. Attributes of communities at risk for unrecognized clusters of hepatitis A infection may include the following:

Recent increases in the:

Number of hepatitis A infections in persons who report drug use;
Number of hepatitis A infections in persons who report homelessness;
Number of hepatitis A infections in men who have sex with men; and
Number of hepatitis A infections in persons who report recent incarceration.
High rates of drug use, drug-related overdose, drug treatment admission, or drug arrests.
High rates of homelessness.
Ensure standard operating procedures to identify and interview cases, perform contact tracing for all new hepatitis A diagnoses, and provide post-exposure vaccination of contacts as soon as the diagnosis is made.
Ensure persons who report drug use (injection and non-injection) or are at high-risk for drug use (e.g., participating in drug substitution programs, receiving substance abuse counseling or treatment, recently or currently incarcerated) are vaccinated against hepatitis A virus, and specifically:

Consider programs to provide hepatitis A vaccinations in jails, syringe service programs, substance abuse treatment programs, and to at-risk persons in emergency departments, homeless shelters, warming centers, food distribution centers, and any venues where the at-risk populations may congregate or seek medical care.

Engage in “Participatory Planning.” Ask the facility what they feel is the best way to provide outreach to their population and what is the best way to provide vaccinations or improve vaccination uptake.
Have a consistent presence at the service provider if vaccinations are planned on-site. If repeat visits must occur, they should occur on scheduled days and times.
Adequately advertise vaccination events beforehand.
Engage stakeholders who care for persons who use drugs or may interact more frequently with facilities serving this population (e.g., behavioral specialists, disease intervention specialists).
Provide education to persons who report drug use and/or homelessness through targeted media campaigns encouraging vaccination and proper hand hygiene.
Remind venues that may encounter undiagnosed infections, such as emergency departments and community-based clinical practices (e.g., family medicine, general medicine) of the importance of reporting hepatitis A infections to the health department.
18
Local health departments should notify their state health department and CDC (viralhepatitisoutbreak@cdc.gov) of any suspected clusters of acute hepatitis A.
Recommendations for Health Care Providers
Consider hepatitis A as a diagnosis in anyone with jaundice and clinically compatible symptoms.
Encourage persons who have been exposed recently to HAV and who have not been vaccinated to be administered one dose of single-antigen hepatitis A vaccine or immune globulin (IG) as soon as possible, 
within 2 weeks after exposure
. Guidelines vary by age and health status (please see 
https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/outbreaks/InterimOutbreakGuidance-HAV-VaccineAdmin.htm
 for additional information).
Consider saving serum samples for additional testing to assist public health officials in the investigation of transmission (i.e., confirmation of antibody test, HAV RNA test, genotyping, and sequencing). Contact the public health department for assistance with submitting specimens for molecular characterization.
Ensure all persons diagnosed with hepatitis A are reported to the health department in a timely manner.
Encourage hepatitis A vaccination for homeless individuals in areas where hepatitis A outbreaks are occurring.
Encourage hepatitis A vaccination for persons who report drug use or other risk factors for hepatitis A.
CDC recommends the following groups be vaccinated against hepatitis A:

All children at age 1 year
Persons who are at increased risk for infection:

Persons traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A;
Men who have sex with men;
Persons who use injection and non-injection drugs;
Persons who have occupational risk for infection;
Persons who have chronic liver disease;
Persons who have clotting-factor disorders;
Household members and other close personal contacts or adopted children newly arriving from countries with high or intermediate hepatitis A endemicity; and
Persons with direct contact with persons who have hepatitis A.
Persons who are at increased risk for complications from hepatitis A, including people with chronic liver diseases, such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C.
Any person wishing to obtain immunity.","['https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/outbreaks/InterimOutbreakGuidance-HAV-VaccineAdmin.htm', 'https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/outbreaks/2017March-HepatitisA.htm']"

Summary
This Health Alert Network (HAN) Update provides current recommendations on management and reporting of 
Shigella
 infections that have been treated with ciprofloxacin or azithromycin and resulted in possible clinical treatment failure. This is a follow-up to 
HAN 401: CDC Recommendations for Diagnosing and Managing 
Shigella
 Strains with Possible Reduced Susceptibility to Ciprofloxacin
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to identify an increasing number of 
Shigella
 isolates that test within the susceptible range for the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] values of 0.12-1 μg/mL), but harbor one or more resistance mechanisms. CDC remains concerned about potential clinical failures with fluoroquinolone treatment.
Clinicians should carefully monitor patients with 
Shigella 
infections who require fluoroquinolone treatment and report any possible treatment failures. If treatment failure is suspected, clinicians should submit a stool specimen for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and consider consulting an infectious disease specialist to identify best treatment options.
CDC has also identified an increasing number of 
Shigella
 isolates with azithromycin MICs that exceed the epidemiological cutoff value (ECV), and is requesting reports of any possible treatment failures occurring among patients with 
Shigella
 infections treated with azithromycin (see below).
Shigellosis is a nationally notifiable condition; all cases should be reported to local health departments.
Recommendations for Clinicians
If antibiotic treatment is necessary, monitor patients carefully.
If you identify or receive a report of a patient with 
Shigella
 infection and possible fluoroquinolone or azithromycin treatment failure:
Background
In April 2017, CDC identified an increase in the percentage of 
Shigella
 isolates in the United States with MIC values of 0.12–1 μg/mL for the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin; this percentage continues to rise. Preliminary surveillance data from 2016 show that 8.2% of 
Shigella
 isolates tested by the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System laboratory (
https://www.cdc.gov/narms
) had a ciprofloxacin MIC in the 0.12–1 μg/mL range, and 9.5% had an azithromycin MIC greater than the ECV (i.e., non-wild-type; reduced susceptibility). Testing of 2017 surveillance isolates is ongoing. Among those tested, 16.5% have a ciprofloxacin MIC in the 0.12–1 μg/mL range, and 22.1% have reduced susceptibility to azithromycin. Molecular data indicate that most 
Shigella
 isolates with ciprofloxacin MICs in the noted range harbor at least one quinolone resistance mechanism. 
Shigella
 isolates without a quinolone resistance mechanism typically have a ciprofloxacin MIC of ≤0.015 μg/mL. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) criteria categorize 
Shigella
 isolates with a ciprofloxacin MIC of ≤1 μg/mL as susceptible to ciprofloxacin. Currently, clinical laboratories have limited ability to differentiate the ciprofloxacin MIC values within the reduced susceptibility range, ≤1 μg/mL. Additionally, CLSI does not have established azithromycin clinical breakpoints for 
Shigella
 isolates, only ECVs, which do not predict clinical outcome (2).
CDC is particularly concerned about people who are at high risk for multidrug-resistant 
Shigella
 infections and are more likely to require antibiotic treatment, such as men who have sex with men, patients who are homeless, and immunocompromised patients. These patients often have more severe disease, prolonged shedding, and recurrent infections.
In response to data and concerns presented by CDC, CLSI formed an 
ad hoc
 working group in June 2017 to assess any available and relevant clinical, pharmacologic, and microbiologic data. The workgroup found that no data are available on the high-risk populations of concern. CDC has not received any reports of clinical treatment failures in patients with 
Shigella
 infections. Therefore, it is unclear whether fluoroquinolone treatment of a 
Shigella
 infection with a ciprofloxacin MIC of 0.12–1 μg/mL is associated with a worse clinical outcome or whether such treatment increases the risk of transmission. At this time, CLSI ciprofloxacin MIC breakpoints for the 
Enterobacteriaceae
 family (excluding 
Salmonella
) will continue to apply to 
Shigella
 isolates.
CDC is working with CLSI and other partners to collect isolates and clinical information from people with 
Shigella
 infection and possible clinical treatment failure occurring after treatment with a fluoroquinolone or azithromycin. If treatment failure is suspected, clinicians should consider consulting an infectious disease specialist to identify best treatment options, and submit a stool specimen for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Clinicians should monitor patients carefully and report cases of possible clinical treatment failure to CDC.","['https://www.cdc.gov/shigella/resources.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/shigella/audience-sexually-active.html']"

Synthetic cannabinoids are not one drug. Hundreds of different synthetic cannabinoid chemicals are manufactured and sold (1). New ones with unknown health risks become available each year. These chemicals are called 
cannabinoids 
because they act on the same brain cell receptors as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active ingredient in marijuana; however, synthetic cannabinoids may affect the brain in different and unpredictable ways compared to THC (2). Synthetic cannabinoids are used in a variety of ways including: 1) sprayed onto plant material and then smoked; 2) used in electronic nicotine delivery devices (such as e-cigarettes); or 3) ingested when added to herbal tea or food.
Synthetic cannabinoids are widely available. Consumers can buy synthetic cannabinoids in convenience stores, from individual drug dealers, friends, or online as incense or natural herbal products. They are sold under many different brand names, but are commonly referred to as synthetic marijuana, fake weed, legal weed, K2, and Spice. Adverse effects from synthetic cannabinoids use vary and can include neurological (e.g., agitation, confusion), psychiatric (e.g., hallucinations, delusions), and other physical (e.g., tachypnea, tachycardia, gastrointestinal distress) signs and symptoms (1-3).
Outbreak
 
Background

In March 2018, the Illinois Department of Public Health reported cases of unexplained bleeding among patients who reported using synthetic cannabinoids. Subsequent testing of drug and biological samples from case-patients detected the presence of brodifacoum, a long-acting vitamin K-dependent antagonist that is used as a rodenticide (4).
CDC is currently coordinating national surveillance activities for possible cases of vitamin K-dependent antagonist coagulopathy associated with synthetic cannabinoids use. Since the index case was identified in Illinois on March 3, 2018, state health departments have reported 202 cases, including five deaths, to CDC. Case patients have been identified in nine states with the majority being reported from Illinois (n=164). Maryland has reported 20 cases. Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin have reported six or fewer cases per state. More than 95 of case-patient biological samples have tested positive for brodifacoum. The current working hypothesis is that brodifacoum was mixed with synthetic cannabinoids products.
Case-patients from this outbreak have presented with a variety of signs and symptoms of coagulopathy (e.g., bruising, nosebleeds, excessively heavy menstrual bleeding, hematemesis, hemoptysis, hematuria, flank pain, abdominal pain, and bleeding gums or mouth). In addition, some patients have been asymptomatic or presented with complaints unrelated to bleeding but have had numerical coagulopathy that may put them at risk for bleeding complications resulting from injuries and invasive or surgical procedures. Patients should be considered high-risk for coagulopathy if they have reported use of or are suspected of using synthetic cannabinoids.
The most helpful and commonly available laboratory test to help identify cases is the International Normalized Ratio (INR) that is part of a routine coagulation profile. An abnormal INR is defined as being outside the reference laboratory value. For case reporting purposes, an INR>2 is being used as a criteria to help identify and classify possible cases. Case confirmation requires detection of brodifacoum in blood, serum, plasma, or urine, as determined by reference laboratory testing. Clinicians and healthcare providers should work with their healthcare facility’s laboratory to determine what options are available to them for brodifacoum testing.
Recommendations
Recommendations for Clinicians
Maintain a high index of suspicion for vitamin K-dependent antagonist coagulopathy in patients with a history or suspicion of using synthetic cannabinoids. Patients may present with clinical signs of coagulopathy, bleeding unrelated to an injury, or bleeding without another explanation. Some patients may be asymptomatic or present with complaints unrelated to bleeding but have numerical coagulopathy. NOTE: Some patients may not divulge synthetic cannabinoids use.
Ask all patients about history of illicit drug use. All high-risk patients (e.g., those reporting synthetic cannabinoids use or those who are suspected of synthetic cannabinoids use within the last three months), regardless of their presentation, should be screened for vitamin K-dependent antagonist coagulopathy by checking their coagulation profile (e.g., INR).
Possible cases should be asked if they have recently donated plasma or blood (e.g., in the last three months). Clinicians treating possible cases who have recently donated plasma or blood should notify their state health department, who can then notify the FDA.
Proceduralists (e.g., trauma/general/orthopedic/oral/OB-GYN/cosmetic surgeons, dentists, interventional cardiologists/radiologists, and nephrologists) should be aware that patients with a history of using synthetic cannabinoids may be anti-coagulated without clinical signs of coagulopathy. These patients should be screened for vitamin K-dependent antagonist coagulopathy 
prior
 to their procedure.
Patients sent home from surgeries or other procedures that could result in bleeding should be told not to use synthetic cannabinoids because of the risk that the product may be contaminated with an anticoagulant.
Contact your local poison control center (1-800-222-1222) for questions on diagnostic testing and management of these patients.
Promptly report possible cases to your local or state health department.
Recommendations for Public Health Officials
Promptly report possible cases to CDC via 
NCEHOutbreak@cdc.gov
Contact CDC for case classification criteria, reporting guidelines, case investigation forms, and other questions at the above email.
Consider conducting case-finding activities that leverage existing data sources such as your local poison control center, coroner/medical examiner’s office, and other applicable surveillance systems.
In an effort to better understand the scope of this outbreak, ask your Medical Examiners’ office to report possible cases, especially those without an alternative, likely diagnosis. If individuals are identified after death or at autopsy showing signs of suspicious bleeding as described above, coroners are encouraged to report the cases to their local health department.
Recommendations for the Public
CDC recommends that people do not use synthetic cannabinoids. Synthetic cannabinoids are always dangerous because it is impossible for people to know what chemicals are in the product, how much they are being exposed to, and how their body will react to the chemicals. The synthetic cannabinoid products associated with this outbreak are especially dangerous because they contain brodifacoum, a chemical used as rat poison that can cause uncontrolled bleeding.
People who have used synthetic cannabinoids in the past three months and are concerned about their health should contact their healthcare provider. Synthetic cannabinoids users who develop any unusual bruising or bleeding should seek medical attention immediately.","['https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/hsb/chemicals/sc/default.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/hsb/chemicals/sc/healthcare.html']"

Summary
In October 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowed marketing of the OraQuick® Ebola Rapid Antigen Test, a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for detecting Ebola virus in both symptomatic patients and recently deceased people. This is the first Ebola RDT that FDA has allowed for marketing in the United States. The RDT should be used only in cases where more sensitive molecular testing is not available. All OraQuick® Ebola Rapid Antigen Test results are presumptive; all test results (positive and negative) must be verified through real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing at a Laboratory Response Network (LRN) laboratory located in 49 states and at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Interpretation of RDT results should be done with caution and in consultation with relevant public health authorities to ensure appropriate testing and interpretation of results. RDT results should not be used to rule out Ebola infection or to determine the use or type of infection prevention and control precautions when managing a patient with Ebola compatible symptoms and epidemiologic risk factors. Healthcare providers with a patient with possible Ebola virus infection should first contact their local or state public health authorities before any testing is performed. CDC is available to provide consultation, technical assistance, and confirmatory testing as necessary.
Background
Ebola virus disease
 (Ebola) is a rare and deadly disease caused by infection with viruses within the genus 
Ebolavirus
. There are four known species within genus 
Ebolavirus
 that are known to cause disease in humans: Ebola virus (species 
Zaire ebolavirus
), Sudan virus (species 
Sudan ebolavirus
), Bundibugyo virus (species 
Bundibugyo ebolavirus
), and Taï Forest virus (species 
Taï Forest ebolavirus
). People can become infected through contact with blood or body fluids of a person infected with or who has died of Ebola. Ebola virus can also be spread through contact with contaminated objects or infected animals. Symptoms of Ebola can include fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, abdominal pain, weakness and fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea and vomiting, and bleeding or bruising.
An outbreak of Ebola (associated with 
Zaire ebolavirus
) is occurring in the South Kivu, North Kivu, and Ituri provinces in northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). First declared on August 1, 2018, the outbreak is the second largest Ebola outbreak in history and the largest that has ever occurred in DRC. As of December 9, 2019, more than 3,200 confirmed cases and more than 2,000 confirmed deaths have been reported. Despite this, the risk of Ebola virus infection for most U.S.-based travelers to DRC is low, and the risk of global spread of Ebola to the United States and elsewhere is also low. Only those going to the outbreak area or who otherwise have contact with an Ebola-infected person (living or deceased) are at risk. Family and friends caring for people with Ebola and health care workers who do not use correct infection control precautions are at higher risk (1).
The OraQuick® Ebola Rapid Antigen Test was originally developed as a tool for rapid presumptive diagnosis of Ebola in outbreak settings and is useful in low-resource areas where access to more sensitive molecular testing is difficult. This test is not intended to be used for general Ebola infection screening or testing of asymptomatic people or those without risk factors and compatible symptoms of Ebola. The test has shown to be capable of detecting antigens for three species of 
Ebolavirus
: 
Zaire ebolavirus, Bundibugyo ebolavirus
, and 
Sudan
 
ebolavirus 
(2).; however, the test cannot differentiate between species. In the United States, presumptive testing for Ebola virus (
Zaire ebolavirus
) is available at 69 Laboratory Response Network (LRN) laboratories located in 49 states using rRT-PCR, accessible through coordination with state or local public health authorities. Molecular testing at CDC is available to confirm these results and is also required to differentiate between species of 
Ebolavirus
Recommendations
CDC recommends that Ebola virus testing be conducted only for people who have an epidemiologic risk factor within 21 days of symptom onset and who have an Ebola compatible clinical syndrome. The signs and symptoms of Ebola are non-specific, both in the early and advanced clinical course. Because most travelers are at low to no risk of becoming infected with Ebola, other more common differentials with similar clinical symptomatology such as malaria, dengue, influenza, or typhoid should be considered. Since August 1, 2018, CDC has received clinical inquiries from state and local health departments for 49 ill returning travelers from DRC or the surrounding countries. Of these, testing for Ebola virus was recommended for one returning traveler. The traveler tested negative for Ebola and was subsequently diagnosed with malaria.
Healthcare providers interested in testing for Ebola virus in ill returning travelers should isolate the patient and contact their state or local public health authorities. An assessment of epidemiologic risk factors for Ebola and clinical presentation and history should be made as quickly as possible to ensure patient care is not compromised. CDC is available to provide consultation, technical assistance, and confirmatory testing as necessary.
State public health authorities or healthcare facilities in the United States considering integrating the OraQuick® Ebola Rapid Antigen Test into their Ebola testing algorithms or preparedness protocols should consider the following:
The RDT should be used only in circumstances where more sensitive molecular testing is not available.
RDTs should be used only in collaboration and consultation with relevant public health authorities to ensure appropriate testing and interpretation of results.
All results (positive and negative) from the OraQuick® Ebola Rapid Antigen Test are presumptive and must be verified through rRT-PCR testing that is available at 69 LRN laboratories located in 49 states and at CDC. Testing at LRN laboratories is coordinated through state or local public health authorities.
Per existing protocols, specimens that test positive by the Ebola virus rRT-PCR assay at an LRN laboratory must be forwarded to CDC for confirmatory testing.
Negative RDT results alone should not be used to rule out Ebola virus infection or to determine the use or type of infection prevention and control precautions when managing a patient with compatible symptoms and epidemiologic risk factors.
The OraQuick® Ebola Rapid Antigen Test may result in false positive results in patients that have elevated rheumatoid factor levels (2). Additionally, potential cross-reactivity of the test with Ebola vaccines or therapeutics is possible and has not been evaluated, and patients who have received vaccines or therapeutics against Ebola virus may have false positive or other confounding results (2). It is important to consult with public health authorities prior to the use of RDTs and to aid in the interpretation of RDT results.
Facilities that collect and handle specimens from patients with suspected cases of Ebola should ensure adequate biosafety protocols are in place for the handling and disposal of all potentially infectious materials to avoid risk of inadvertent exposure (3). For healthcare providers collecting specimens, appropriate personal protective equipment should be used (4,5).

Summary
Hot tub displays at temporary events may pose a risk for Legionnaires’ disease, a type of pneumonia caused by inhaling mist containing 
Legionella
 bacteria. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is alerting environmental and public health practitioners about the public health need to maintain, clean and disinfect hot tubs properly to reduce potential exposure to 
Legionella
. This Health Advisory provides guidance for environmental and public health practitioners to minimize risk for 
Legionella
 exposure from hot tub displays at temporary events (e.g., fairs, home and garden shows, conventions). Environmental health practitioners should work with event planners and hot tub vendors to minimize the risk of 
Legionella
 exposure even if the hot tub is only for display.
Background
Legionella
 grows best in warm water (77°F-108°F), like the water temperatures used in hot tubs. Warm temperatures also make it hard to keep disinfectants, such as chlorine, at the levels needed to kill bacteria like 
Legionella
. Disinfectant and other chemical levels in hot tubs should be checked regularly. Hot tubs should be cleaned as the manufacturer recommends.
A hot tub that is not adequately maintained can expose people to 
Legionella
 bacteria even if they do not get in it. This makes display hot tubs at temporary events a risk for Legionnaires’ disease if they contain 
Legionella
 bacteria. People with symptoms of 
Legionella
 exposure who have recent exposure to a hot tub filled with water should be encouraged to seek medical care.
Exposure to 
Legionella
 via aerosol or aspiration of water containing 
Legionella
 can lead to Legionnaires’ disease or Pontiac fever. Legionnaires’ disease is a severe type of pneumonia. Signs and symptoms can include cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, headache, and fever.[1] Most people get sick within 10 days of exposure, though the incubation period can be as long as 14 days. Pontiac fever symptoms are primarily fever and muscle aches; it is a milder illness than Legionnaires’ disease, and pneumonia is absent. Symptoms begin between a few hours to three days after being exposed to the bacteria and usually last less than a week. Diagnostic and treatment information for clinicians can be found at: 
https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/downloads/fs-legionella-clinicians.pdf
pdf icon
Hot tubs have been associated with large outbreaks of Legionnaires’ disease.[2,3] The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services investigated an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease associated with a state fair in September 2019. As of November 13, 2019, 139 confirmed cases (134 Legionnaires’ disease and 5 Pontiac fever) have been identified, resulting in 96 hospitalizations and 4 deaths.[4] Interim conclusions from the investigation suggest that exposure to 
Legionella
 bacteria occurred in an events center building where vendors were displaying hot tubs.[5] Their findings highlight the importance of proper operation and maintenance of devices that aerosolize water.
Recommendations for Environmental and Public Health Practitioners
Contact organizers of temporary events where hot tubs may be on display and operating in a public setting. Provide information about Legionnaires’ disease and proper hot tub maintenance.
When investigating a suspected case of Legionnaires’ disease associated with hot tubs—

Immediately turn off the hot tub and prevent its use to minimize exposure through aerosolization of water.
If requested by outbreak lead investigator, collect water and swab samples for 
Legionella 
testing.
Disinfect the hot tub using CDC’s recommended best practices.[6]
Close the display and remove it from public access.
Recommendations for Hot Tub Owners and Operators 
Event planners and hot tub vendors should know about the risk that hot tubs pose when not maintained adequately, even if the hot tub is for display only. At vendor events where a hot tub is on display, the equipment vendor, display manager, or operator should—

Obtain operator and chemical handling training, if required by state or local authorities. National training courses are listed at CDC’s 
Pool/Spa Inspector Training
 website (
https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/swimming/public-health-professionals/pool-spa-inspector-training.html
).
Ensure trained vendor staff are available at the display during operational hours.
Maintain free chlorine (2–4 parts per million or ppm) or bromine (4–6 ppm) levels continuously.
Maintain the pH level of the water at 7.2–7.8.
Test pH and disinfectant levels at least twice per day.
Maintain accurate records of disinfectant and pH measurements and maintenance activities.
At the end of each event, hot tub vendors should (in accordance with manufacturer recommendations, where applicable)—

Clean the hot tub.
Apply a biocidal shock treatment.
Drain it, removing as much water from the system as possible.
Remove filters.
Leave filters to dry.
Clean filters before reuse.
Replace filters when recommended by the manufacturer.
Protect the hot tub from external water sources (e.g., condensation drip, rain, humidity, moisture).
Keep the hot tub as dry as possible between events.","['https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/swimming/public-health-professionals/pool-spa-inspector-training.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fhealthywater%2Fswimming%2Fpools%2Fcertification-training-education.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/swimming/public-health-professionals/pool-spa-inspector-training.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/mahc/editions/current.html']"

Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is providing: 1) background information on the forms of e-cigarette products, 2) information on the multistate outbreak of severe pulmonary disease associated with using e-cigarette products (devices, liquids, refill pods, and cartridges), and 3) clinical features of patients with severe pulmonary disease. 
This health advisory also provides recommendations for clinicians, public health officials, and the public based on currently available information.
General Background

E-cigarettes typically contain nicotine, most also contain flavorings and other chemicals, and some may contain marijuana or other substances. They are known by many different names and come in many shapes, sizes and device types. Devices may be referred to as “e-cigs,” “vapes,” “e-hookahs,” “vape pens,” “mods,” tanks, or electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). Some e-cigarette devices resemble other tobacco products such as cigarettes; some resemble ordinary household items such as USB flash drives, pens, and flashlights; and others have unique shapes. Use of e-cigarettes is sometimes referred to as “vaping” or “juuling.” E-cigarettes used for dabbing are sometimes called “dab” pens.
E-cigarettes can contain harmful or potentially harmful substances, including nicotine, heavy metals (e.g., lead), volatile organic compounds, and cancer-causing chemicals. Additionally, some e-cigarette products are used to deliver illicit substances; may be acquired from unknown or unauthorized (i.e., “street”) sources; and may be modified for uses that could increase their potential for harm to the user. For example, some e-cigarette pods or cartridges marketed for single use can be refilled with illicit or unknown substances. In addition, some e-cigarette products are used for “dripping” or “dabbing.” Dripping involves dropping e-cigarette liquid directly onto the hot coils of an e-cigarette which can result in high concentrations of compounds (e.g., tetrahydrocannabinol [THC] and cannabinoid compounds). Dabbing involves superheating substances such as “budder”, butane hash oil (BHO), and “710” that contain high concentrations of THC and other plant compounds (e.g., cannabidiol [CBD]).
Youth, young adults, pregnant women, as well as adults who do not currently use tobacco products should not use e-cigarettes. E-cigarettes containing nicotine have the potential to help some individual adult smokers reduce their use of and transition away from cigarettes. However, e-cigarettes are not currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a quit smoking aid, and the available science is inconclusive on whether e-cigarettes are effective for quitting smoking.
Outbreak Background

As of August 27, 2019, 215 possible cases have been reported from 25 states and additional reports of pulmonary illness are under investigation. One patient (in Illinois) with a history of recent e-cigarette use was hospitalized with severe pulmonary disease and subsequently died. Although the etiology of e-cigarette-associated pulmonary disease is undetermined, epidemiologic investigations in affected states are ongoing to better characterize the exposures, demographic, clinical, and laboratory features and behaviors of patients. All patients have reported using e-cigarette products. The exact number is currently unknown, but many patients have reported using e-cigarettes containing cannabinoid products such as THC or CBD.
Based on reports from several states, patients have experienced respiratory symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain), and some have also experienced gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea) or non-specific constitutional symptoms (fatigue, fever, or weight loss). Symptoms typically develop over a period of days but sometimes can manifest over several weeks. Gastrointestinal symptoms sometimes preceded respiratory symptoms. Fever, tachycardia, and elevated white blood cell count have been reported in the absence of an identifiable infectious disease. Many patients have sought initial care in ambulatory settings, some with several visits, before hospital admission.
Radiologic findings have varied and are not present in all patients upon initial presentation. Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and diffuse ground-glass opacities have been reported. Many patients required supplemental oxygen, some required assisted ventilation and oxygenation, and some were intubated. Some patients have been treated with corticosteroids with demonstrated improvement. Antimicrobial therapy alone has not consistently been associated with clinical improvement. Assessment for infectious etiologies has been completed in many patients without an identified infectious cause. Several patients from one state have been diagnosed with lipoid pneumonia based on clinical presentation and detection of lipids within bronchoalveolar lavage samples stained specifically to detect oil.
All patients have reported using e-cigarette products and the symptom onset has ranged from a few days to several weeks after e-cigarette use.  Within two states, recent inhalation of cannabinoid products, THC or cannabidiol, have been reported in many of the patients. To date, no single substance or e-cigarette product has been consistently associated with illness. CDC is working closely with state health departments to facilitate collecting product specimens for testing at the U.S. FDA Forensic Chemistry Center.
Recommendations for Clinicians
Report cases of severe pulmonary disease of unclear etiology and a history of e-cigarette product use within the past 90 days to your state or local health department. Reporting of cases may help CDC and state health departments determine the cause or causes of these pulmonary illnesses.
Ask all patients who report e-cigarette product use within the last 90 days about signs and symptoms of pulmonary illness.
If e-cigarette product use is suspected as a possible etiology of a patient’s severe pulmonary disease, obtain detailed history regarding:

Substance(s) used: nicotine, cannabinoids (e.g., marijuana, THC, THC concentrates, CBD, CBD oil, synthetic cannabinoids [e.g., K2 or spice], hash oil, Dank vapes), flavors, or other substances
Substance source(s): commercially available liquids (i.e., bottles, cartridges, or pods), homemade liquids, and re-use of old cartridges or pods with homemade or commercially bought liquids
Device(s) used: manufacturer; brand name; product name; model; serial number of the product, device, or e-liquid; if the device can be customized by the user; and any product modifications by the user (e.g., exposure of the atomizer or heating coil)
Where the product(s) were purchased
Method of substance use: aerosolization, dabbing, or dripping
Other potential cases: sharing e-cigarette products (devices, liquids, refill pods, or cartridges) with others
Determine if any remaining product, including devices and liquids, are available for testing. Testing can be coordinated with the local or state health departments.
Consider all possible causes of illness in patients reporting respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms and of e-cigarette product use. Evaluate and treat for other possible causes of illness (e.g., infectious, rheumatologic, neoplastic) as clinically indicated. Consider consultation with specialists (pulmonary, infectious disease, critical care, medical toxicology) as appropriate.
Clinical improvement of patients with severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use has been reported with the use of corticosteroids. The decision to use corticosteroids should be made on a case-by-case basis based on risks and benefits and the likelihood of other etiologies.
Lipoid pneumonia associated with inhalation of lipids in aerosols generated by e-cigarettes has been reported based on the detection of lipid-laden alveolar macrophages obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lipid staining (e.g., oil red O). The decision about whether to perform a BAL should be based on individual clinical circumstances.
Lung biopsies have been performed on some patients. If a lung biopsy is obtained, lipid staining may be considered during pathologic examination, and is best performed on fresh tissue. Routine pathology tissue processing (including formalin-fixation and paraffin-embedding) can remove lipids. Conducting routine tissue processing and histopathologic evaluation is still important. Consider consultation with specialists in pulmonary medicine and pathology to help inform any evaluation plan.
Patients who have received treatment for severe pulmonary disease related to e-cigarette product use should undergo follow-up evaluation as clinically indicated to monitor pulmonary function.
Recommendations for Public Health Officials
State public health officials should promptly notify CDC about possible cases via 
VapingAssocIllness@cdc.gov
Contact CDC at 
VapingAssocIllness@cdc.gov
 for case classification criteria, reporting guidelines, case investigation forms, and questions about this outbreak.
Consider conducting case-finding activities that use existing data sources (e.g., local poison control center, coroner and medical examiner’s office, and other applicable surveillance systems including syndromic surveillance). CDC has developed two working syndromic surveillance definitions (one version with specific symptoms and a second focused on e-cigarette product use). CDC will be programming these definitions in CDC’s National Syndromic Surveillance Program’s BioSense/ESSENCE platform for case-finding within the platform.
Consider asking the medical examiner or coroner’s office and other pathologists to report possible cases, especially those without an alternative, likely diagnosis. If individuals are identified after death or at autopsy who showed signs of severe pulmonary disease as described above, medical examiners and coroners are encouraged to report the cases to their local or state health department. Thorough sampling of trachea, bronchi, and lung parenchyma with collection of fresh lung tissue for staining of lipids (e.g., oil red O) and submission of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues for routine histopathology are recommended. For further consultation, public health officials can contact CDC’s Infectious Diseases Pathology Branch at 
pathology@cdc.gov
State health department officials seeking technical assistance with an epidemiologic investigation can contact CDC at 
VapingAssocIllness@cdc.gov
. State health department officials seeking technical assistance with laboratory testing can discuss with their state health department laboratories or contact CDC at 
VapingAssocIllness@cdc.gov
Recommendations for the Public
While this investigation is ongoing, if you are concerned about these specific health risks, consider refraining from using e-cigarette products
. 
Regardless of the ongoing investigation, anyone who uses e-cigarette products should not buy these products off the street (e.g., e-cigarette products with THC, other cannabinoids) and should not modify e-cigarette products or add any substances to these products that are not intended by the manufacturer.
Regardless of the ongoing investigation, e-cigarette products should not be used by youth, young adults, pregnant women, as well as adults who do not currently use tobacco products. If you use e-cigarette products, monitor yourself for symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath, chest pain) and promptly seek medical attention if you have concerns about your health. CDC and FDA will continue to advise and alert the public as more information becomes available.
Adult smokers who are attempting to quit should use evidence-based treatments, including counseling and FDA-approved medications. If you who need help quitting tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, contact your doctor.
If you are concerned about harmful effects from e-cigarette products, call your local poison control center at: 1-800-222-1222.
We encourage the public to submit detailed reports of any unexpected tobacco or e-cigarette-related health or product issues to the FDA via the online Safety Reporting Portal:

Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is expecting a 3 to 10 month nationwide shortage of APLISOL®, a product of Par Pharmaceuticals. APLISOL® is one of two purified-protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin antigens that are licensed by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in performing tuberculin skin tests. The manufacturer notified CDC that they anticipate a supply interruption of APLISOL® 5 mL (50 tests) beginning in June 2019, followed by a supply interruption of APLISOL® 1 mL (10 tests) in November 2019. The expected shortage of APLISOL® 1 mL (10 tests) could occur before November 2019, if demand increases before then.

Background

Two types of immunological methods are used for detecting 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis
 infection: tuberculin skin tests (TSTs) and interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) blood tests. TSTs and IGRAs are used for diagnosing latent TB infection and may aid in diagnosing TB disease. Additional evaluation and testing is necessary to distinguish between latent TB infection and TB disease, and to determine the correct treatment (1). When findings, such as chest radiography and mycobacterial cultures, are sufficient for confirming or excluding the TB diagnosis, the results from a TST or an IGRA blood test might not be needed (1). Most TB cases in the United States are diagnosed with a set of findings including results from one of these tests.
Two FDA-approved PPD tuberculin antigens are available in the United States for use in performing TSTs: TUBERSOL® and APLISOL®. In controlled studies, the concordance between the two products is high (2).
When TB disease is strongly suspected, specific treatment should be started regardless of results from TST or an IGRA blood test (3,4).
Recommendations

CDC recommends three general approaches to prevent a decrease in TB testing capability because of the expected shortage of APLISOL®.
Substitute IGRA blood tests for TSTs. Clinicians who use the IGRA blood tests should be aware that the criteria for test interpretation are different from the criteria for interpreting TSTs (3).
Substitute TUBERSOL® for APLISOL® for skin testing. In cross-sectional studies, the two skin test products give similar results for most patients.
Prioritize allocation of TSTs, in consultation with state and local public health authorities. Prioritization might require the deferment of testing some persons. CDC recommends testing only for persons who are at risk of TB (5-7). High-risk groups for TB infection include:

People who are recent contacts exposed to persons with TB disease;
People born in or who frequently travel to countries where TB disease is common;
People who currently or used to live in large group settings, such as homeless shelters or correctional facilities;
People with weaker immune systems, such as those with certain health conditions or taking certain medications that may alter immunity; and
Children, especially those under age 5, if they are in one of the risk groups noted above.
While overall test concordance is high, switching between PPD skin test products or between TSTs and blood tests in serial testing may cause apparent conversions of results from negative to positive or reversions from positive to negative. This may be due to inherent inter-product or inter-method discordance, rather than change in 
M. tuberculosis 
infection status (3,8). Clinicians should assess test results based on the person’s likelihood of infection and risk of progression to TB disease, if infected (1).
In settings with a low likelihood of TB exposure, the deferment of routine serial testing should be considered in consultation with public health and occupational health authorities. Annual TB testing of health care personnel is not recommended unless there is a known exposure or ongoing transmission (8).

CDC reminds clinicians to have a high suspicion for influenza and recommends rapid antiviral treatment of high-risk patients with suspected influenza.
Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is issuing this health advisory to notify clinicians that influenza activity remains high in the United States, with an increasing proportion of activity due to influenza A(H3N2) viruses, continued circulation of influenza A(H1N1) viruses, and low levels of influenza B viruses. Influenza should be considered as a possible diagnosis for patients with respiratory illness while local influenza activity remains elevated. Because influenza A(H3N2) viruses may be associated with severe disease in older adults, this health advisory serves as a reminder that early empiric treatment with influenza antiviral medications is recommended for hospitalized and high-risk patients, especially those 65 years and older. Antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible after illness onset and should not wait for laboratory confirmation.
Background

In the United States, influenza activity remains elevated and widespread, and the season is likely to last several more weeks (see CDC FluView report for details: 
https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm
). Earlier in the season, influenza A(H1N1) viruses were predominant in most of the country. Although A(H1N1) viruses continue to circulate and remain predominant for the season overall, during the three weeks ending March 16, influenza A(H3N2) viruses have been identified more frequently than A(H1N1) viruses in most of the country. In the past, A(H3N2) virus-predominant influenza seasons have been associated with more hospitalizations and deaths in people 65 years and older than A(H1N1) virus-predominant seasons. Influenza vaccine effectiveness is generally lower against influenza A(H3N2) viruses than against A(H1N1) or B viruses [1]. In addition, one genetic clade of A(H3N2) viruses, the 3C.3a clade, has recently become predominant among circulating A(H3N2) viruses and according to laboratory testing these viruses are antigenically distinct from the A(H3N2) virus included in this season’s vaccine.
CDC recommends antiviral medications for treatment of influenza, regardless of a patient’s influenza vaccination status. Antiviral treatment has been shown to have clinical and public health benefit in reducing illness and severe outcomes of influenza based on evidence from randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials, and observational studies during past influenza seasons and during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic
 [2–9]
. Influenza antiviral medications are most effective in treating influenza and reducing complications when treatment is started early (within 48 hours of illness onset). However, some studies suggest clinical benefit among hospitalized patients and young children with febrile illness even when treatment starts three to five days after illness onset [10–16].
Recommendations
All Hospitalized, Severely Ill, and High-Risk Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Influenza Should Be Treated with Antivirals

Antiviral treatment is recommended as early as possible for any patient with suspected or confirmed influenza who:1) Is hospitalized—treatment is recommended for all hospitalized patients;2) Has severe, complicated, or progressive illness—this may include outpatients with severe or prolonged progressive symptoms or patients who develop complications such as pneumonia but who are not hospitalized;3) Is at high risk for influenza complications but not hospitalized—this includes

Adults 65 years and older.
Children younger than two years. Although all children younger than five years are considered at higher risk for complications from influenza, the highest risk is for those younger than two years.
People with chronic pulmonary (including asthma), cardiovascular (except hypertension alone), renal, hepatic, hematological (including sickle cell disease), and metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus).
People with neurologic and neurodevelopment conditions (including disorders of the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerve, and muscle such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy [seizure disorders], stroke, intellectual disability, moderate to severe developmental delay, muscular dystrophy, or spinal cord injury).
People with immunosuppression, including that caused by medications or by HIV infection.
Women who are pregnant or postpartum (within two weeks after delivery).
People younger than 19 years who are receiving long-term aspirin therapy.
American Indians and Alaska Natives.
People with extreme obesity (i.e., body-mass index is equal to or greater than 40).
Residents of nursing homes and other chronic-care facilities.
Antivirals in Non-High Risk Patients with Uncomplicated Influenza 

Antiviral treatment can benefit other individuals with influenza. While current guidance focuses on antiviral treatment of those with severe illness or at high risk of complications, antiviral treatment may be prescribed for any previously healthy (non-high risk) outpatient with suspected or confirmed influenza who presents within two days after illness onset. Clinical judgment—considering the patient’s disease severity and progression, age, likelihood of influenza, and time since onset of symptoms—is important when making antiviral treatment decisions for outpatients who are not at increased risk for influenza complications.
Choice of Antiviral Medication

Four influenza antiviral medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are recommended for use in the United States during the 2018-2019 influenza season. Three drugs are chemically related antiviral medications known as neuraminidase inhibitors that block the viral neuraminidase enzyme and have activity against both influenza A and B viruses: oral 
oseltamivir
 
phosphate
 (available as a generic version or under the trade name Tamiflu®), inhaled 
zanamivir
 (trade name Relenza®), and intravenous 
peramivir
 (trade name Rapivab®). The fourth drug is oral 
baloxavir marboxil
 (trade name Xofluza®), which is active against both influenza A and B viruses but has a different mechanism of action. Baloxavir is a cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor that interferes with viral RNA transcription and blocks virus replication. Recommended ages for treatment and prevention with antiviral medications are summarized in the table below. Dosing and more detailed treatment considerations can be found in the Summary of Influenza Antiviral Treatment Recommendations for Clinicians (
http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/antivirals/summary-clinicians.htm
).

*Nausea and vomiting are generally transient and can be mitigated if oseltamivir is taken with food

n/a = not applicable
For outpatients with acute uncomplicated influenza, oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, intravenous peramivir, or oral baloxavir may be used for treatment.

The recommended treatment course for uncomplicated influenza is
Two doses per day of oral oseltamivir for five days, or
Two doses per day of inhaled zanamivir for five days, or
One dose per day of intravenous peramivir for one day, or
One dose per day of oral baloxavir for one day.
Oral or enterically-administered oseltamivir is the only recommended antiviral medication for treatment of hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed influenza and patients with severe or complicated illness with suspected or confirmed influenza (e.g., pneumonia, exacerbation of underlying chronic medical condition) who are not hospitalized.
  There are insufficient data for inhaled zanamivir, intravenous peramivir, and oral baloxavir in patients with severe influenza disease.
Oral oseltamivir is preferred for treatment of pregnant women.
 Pregnant women are recommended to receive the same antiviral dosing as non-pregnant people. Baloxavir is not recommended for the treatment of pregnant women or breastfeeding mothers, as there are no available efficacy or safety data.
Timing of Treatment and Implications for Patient Evaluation, Treatment, and Testing 

Clinical benefit is greatest when antiviral treatment is administered as early as possible after illness onset. Therefore, 
antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible after illness onset and
 
should not be delayed
, even for a few hours to wait for the results of testing. Ideally, treatment should be initiated within 48 hours of symptom onset. However, antiviral treatment initiated later than 48 hours after illness onset can still be beneficial for some patients.
Because of the importance of early treatment, 
decisions about starting antiviral treatment should not wait for laboratory confirmation of influenza
. Therefore, empiric antiviral treatment should be initiated as soon as possible when there is known influenza activity in the community. A history of current season influenza vaccination does not exclude a diagnosis of influenza in an ill child or adult. High-risk patients should be advised to call their provider promptly if they have symptoms of influenza.

March 25, 2019 1330 ET (1:30 PM ET)

CDCHAN-00418
Summary
Multiple states across the country have reported outbreaks of hepatitis A, primarily among people who use drugs and people experiencing homelessness. Since the hepatitis A outbreaks were first identified in 2016, more than 15,000 cases, 8,500 (57%) hospitalizations, and 140 deaths as a result of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection have been reported. This Health Alert Network (HAN) update recommends that public health departments, healthcare facilities, and partners and programs providing services to affected populations vaccinate at-risk groups against hepatitis A, applying the updated recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).
This is an update to the Health Alert Network (HAN) advisory released on June 11, 2018 titled 
Outbreak of Hepatitis A Virus (HAV) Infections among Persons Who Use Drugs and Persons Experiencing Homelessness
 (
https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/han00412.asp
).
 
Background
Multiple states across the country have reported outbreaks of hepatitis A, primarily among people who use drugs and people experiencing homelessness. Since these outbreaks were first identified in 2016, more than 15,000 cases and 8,500 (57%) hospitalizations have been reported. Hospitalization rates have been higher than typically associated with HAV infection.
1, 2
 Severe complications have also been reported, sometimes leading to liver transplantation or death; at least 140 deaths have occurred nationwide.
HAV is highly transmissible from person-to-person. States experiencing large-scale outbreaks have reported widespread transmission soon after their jurisdictions first recognized hepatitis A cases among populations being affected by these outbreaks. For many states, this has resulted in an unprecedented number of hepatitis A cases among unvaccinated adults since hepatitis A vaccine became available in 1996, and has led to prolonged community outbreaks that have been challenging and costly to control.
CDC recommends that public health departments, healthcare providers, and other partners serving affected populations launch a rapid and effective public health response with the following strategies.
 
Recommendations
Offer Vaccination to the Following Groups to Prevent or Control an Outbreak 
The best way to prevent HAV infection is through vaccination with the hepatitis A vaccine. The following groups are at highest risk for acquiring HAV infection or developing serious complications from HAV infection in these outbreaks and should be offered the hepatitis A vaccine:
People who use drugs (injection or non-injection)
People experiencing homelessness 
Men who have sex with men (MSM)
People who are, or were recently, incarcerated
People with chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C
One dose of single-antigen hepatitis A vaccine has been shown to control outbreaks of hepatitis A and provides up to 95% seroprotection in healthy individuals for up to 11 years.
3, 4
Pre-vaccination serologic testing is not required to administer hepatitis A vaccine. Vaccinations should not be postponed if vaccination history cannot be obtained or records are unavailable.
New ACIP Recommendations since the June 2018 HAN00412 
https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/han00412.asp
As of November 2, 2018, ACIP recommends hepatitis A vaccine for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for people 12 months of age and older. Providers may also administer immunoglobulin to adults older than 40 years of age, if indicated, and persons who are immunocompromised or have chronic liver disease.
5
As of February 15, 2019, ACIP recommends hepatitis A vaccination for people experiencing homelessness.
6
Health Departments
Outreach 
Identify venues serving populations at-risk for HAV infection, including correctional facilities, syringe service programs, medication-assisted treatment (MAT) facilities, substance use disorder treatment facilities, homeless shelters, emergency departments, and sexually transmitted diseases (STD) clinics. Where ongoing relationships with these facilities and services providers do not exist, engage with partners serving these populations to promote education and vaccination efforts.
Employ novel approaches to improve vaccine delivery to hard-to-reach populations (e.g., Point of Dispensing sites (PODs), mobile outreach teams).
Include hepatitis A vaccination for ACIP-recommended risk groups in routine clinical services to increase vaccination coverage.
Engage multidisciplinary stakeholders (e.g., viral hepatitis or communicable disease experts, epidemiologists, immunization program staff, emergency preparedness staff, disease investigator specialists, health educators, behavioral scientists, harm reduction partners), which is critical for effective response efforts.
Case investigation, contact tracing, and outbreak response monitoring
Implement the new 2019 Acute Hepatitis A Case Definition from the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE).
7
Follow established procedures to interview cases and perform contact tracing for all new hepatitis A diagnoses.
Provide or encourage PEP of previously unvaccinated contacts as soon as possible, within 2 weeks after exposure.
5
Track vaccine delivery and administration to at-risk populations to monitor the outbreak response efforts and improve vaccine coverage among at-risk populations.
Preventing outbreaks
States that are not currently experiencing hepatitis A outbreaks should remain vigilant for hepatitis A cases and proactively develop and implement prevention strategies. This includes outreach to and vaccination of ACIP-recommended risk groups, particularly people who use drugs (injection or non-injection), people experiencing homelessness, MSM, and people with chronic liver disease.
6, 8
As soon as a hepatitis A case is identified in the at-risk populations, states should rapidly mobilize a response to mitigate the threat of HAV transmission.
Healthcare Providers
Screen patients for risk factors (e.g., drug use, homelessness, incarceration, MSM, and chronic liver disease).
Recommend and administer hepatitis A vaccine to at-risk patients, regardless of the original presenting complaint or the type of clinical facility. In particular, the emergency department may be an individual’s only interaction with the healthcare system and is an important opportunity for prevention.
Record immunizations in the state immunization information system (registry).
Consider hepatitis A as a diagnosis in anyone with jaundice or clinically compatible symptoms.
Rapidly report all persons diagnosed with hepatitis A to the health department to ensure timely case investigation and follow-up of contacts.

<h3 align=""center"">Third Case of Rifampin/Penicillin-Resistant Strain of RB51 <em>Brucella </em>from Consuming Raw Milk</h3>





Summary

The New York State Department of Health and Pennsylvania Department of Health are investigating 
Brucella 
RB51 exposures that may be connected to consuming raw (unpasteurized) milk from Miller’s Biodiversity Farm in Quarryville, Pennsylvania. Symptoms of brucellosis can include fever, sweats, malaise, anorexia, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, and potentially more serious complications (e.g., endocarditis, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and neurologic symptoms). In pregnant patients, 
Brucella 
infections can be associated with miscarriage. Symptom onset can occur anywhere from five days to six months following exposure. As of January 22, 2019, exposures have been identified in 19 states: Alabama, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Virginia.
Background

This investigation is associated with the third known case of brucellosis from 
Brucella
 RB51 due to raw milk acquired in the U.S., since August 2017. A New York resident, who drank raw milk purchased from Miller’s Biodiversity Farm in Quarryville, Pennsylvania, was diagnosed with brucellosis in November 2018. Milk samples from the dairy tested positive for 
Brucella 
strain RB51. People who consumed raw milk or raw milk products from this dairy since January 2016 may have been exposed.
Patients who are still 
within six months
 of the date they last consumed the raw milk are at an increased risk for brucellosis and appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is recommended, along with six months of symptom monitoring. Please see diagram below.
If patients are 
outside of the six-month window
 following their last consumption of the raw milk and have or develop an illness consistent with brucellosis, a blood culture should be obtained prior to starting any treatment, preferably while the patient is symptomatic.
Brucella 
strain RB51 is a live-attenuated cattle vaccine strain, which can be shed in milk and can cause infections in humans. RB51 is resistant to rifampin and penicillin. There is no serological test available to detect RB51 infection. Blood culture is the recommended diagnostic test for exposed individuals who are symptomatic.
1
Recommendations

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the following:
A 21-day course of both doxycycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for first-line PEP for RB51 exposure.
2
 If brucellosis occurs despite prophylaxis, treatment should be pursued; alternative options should be considered for those with contraindications to the stated PEP and treatment regimens.
2
 Please note that RB51 is resistant to rifampin and penicillin.
When ordering blood cultures to diagnose brucellosis, please advise the laboratory that blood culture may grow 
Brucella 
and that appropriate laboratory containment and precautions should be observed.
3
Advise patients to discard any leftover or stored, raw milk or raw milk products from this dairy farm.
Please see the diagram below for information on developing an evaluation and treatment plan for patients who consumed raw milk or raw milk products from Miller’s Biodiversity Farm since January 2016, and are 
still within the six-month window following their last known exposure
Note: 
Testing for asymptomatic patients is not recommended.

Summary

Most commercially available alcohol-based hand sanitizers or rubs (ABHSR) contain either ethanol or isopropanol as active ingredients. On June 19, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advised consumers not to use any hand sanitizer manufactured by “Eskbiochem SA de CV” in Mexico, due to the potential presence of 
methanol
, a “toxic alcohol”, as an active ingredient, which can cause blindness and/or death when absorbed through the skin or when swallowed. Since then, FDA has identified additional ABHSR products that contain methanol and is working with manufacturers and distributors on a voluntary recall of these products (
https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-updates-hand-sanitzers-methanol
external icon
).
Clinicians and public health officials should advise the public to:

1) Seek immediate medical attention and contact their poison center (1-800-222-1222) for advice if they have swallowed an ABHSR product or are experiencing symptoms from repeated use of these products that are on the “FDA’s testing and manufacturer’s recalls” list (
https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-updates-hand-sanitzers-methanol
external icon
),

2) Stop using any ABHSR that are on the “FDA’s testing and manufacturer’s recalls” list because using these methanol-containing products may result in serious adverse health events (e.g., blindness and death), and

3) NEVER swallow ABHSR and only use them for their intended purpose. Clinicians should be highly suspicious of methanol poisoning when a patient presents with a history of ABHSR ingestion, compatible signs and symptoms, and laboratory findings.
Background

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed with the New Mexico Department of Health and the New Mexico Poison and Drug Information Center that serious adverse health events occurred in seven patients who had purportedly ingested ABHSR in June 2020. Significant blood methanol concentrations were detected in all patients; four died, one critically ill patient recovered with loss of vision, and outcomes are pending on the remaining two critically ill patients. Two product samples were available for testing; preliminary results showed one product tested positive for methanol at the Scientific Laboratory Division, New Mexico Department of Health; the result on the second product is pending. CDC also confirmed with the Arizona Department of Health Services that the Arizona Poison and Drug Information Center reported an additional six patients who purportedly ingested ABHSR in June 2020. Significant blood methanol concentrations were detected in these critically ill patients; two patients have been discharged from the hospital, one has permanent blindness, and four outcomes are pending.
Hand hygiene is an important part of the response to the emergence of COVID-19 in the United States. Practicing hand hygiene, which includes using ABHSR, is a simple and effective way to decrease the spread of pathogens and infections. Commercially available ABHSR usually contain either ethanol or isopropanol. However, some ABHSR that were manufactured in Mexico (
https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-updates-hand-sanitzers-methanol
external icon
) have been found to contain a significant amount of methanol. Repeated use of these products on the skin may result in methanol poisoning. However, the highest risk for methanol poisoning is by swallowing ABHSR products containing methanol. Examples include young children who accidentally swallow these products and adolescents or adults who intentionally swallow these products as an alcohol (ethanol) substitute. The clinical effects of methanol and ethanol poisoning are similar (e.g., headache, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, loss of coordination, and decreased level of consciousness), but methanol poisoning may result in severe metabolic acidosis and blindness, and can be fatal if untreated. Clinicians should be highly suspicious of methanol poisoning when a patient presents with a history of ABHSR ingestion, compatible signs and symptoms, and laboratory findings (e.g., elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis). Treatment of methanol poisoning includes supportive care, administration of an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor (e.g., fomepizole), and hemodialysis.
Recommendations for Clinicians and Public Health Officials
Clinicians
 should advise patients to immediately seek medical treatment if they have been exposed to methanol-containing alcohol-based hand sanitizers on the “FDA’s testing and manufacturer’s recalls” list (
https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-updates-hand-sanitzers-methanol
external icon
) and are experiencing symptoms.
Clinicians
 should have a high index of suspicion for methanol poisoning when a patient presents with a history of ABHSR ingestion or repeated use of these products on the skin. Signs and symptoms include headache, blurred vision or blindness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, loss of coordination, decreased level of consciousness, and laboratory findings such as anion gap metabolic acidosis.
Clinicians and public health practitioners
 should educate patients and the public to use alcohol-based hand sanitizers or rubs 
only
 for hand hygiene.
Clinicians and public health practitioners
 should educate patients and the public on the serious adverse health risks of ingesting alcohol-based hand sanitizers or rubs.
Clinicians and public health practitioners
 should educate patients and the public that some alcohol-based hand sanitizers or rubs may contain a significant amount of methanol and using these products may result in serious adverse health events (e.g., blindness and death).
Clinicians
 should contact the local poison center (1-800-222-1222) to report cases and to obtain specific medical management advice of methanol poisoning.
Recommendations for the Public
Seek immediate medical attention if you have swallowed alcohol-based hand sanitizer or rub or are experiencing symptoms from repeated use of these products on your skin and contact your poison center (1-800-222-1222) for advice. Signs and symptoms include headache, blurred vision or blindness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, loss of coordination, and decreased alertness.
Do 
not
 swallow any alcohol-based hand sanitizers or rubs. These chemicals are not intended for human consumption and can lead to serious health issues, including death.
Only
 use alcohol-based hand sanitizers or rubs for their intended purpose – to clean hands.
Keep alcohol-based hand sanitizers or rubs out of reach of children and supervise their use.
Check your hand sanitizer products against the “FDA’s testing and manufacturer’s recalls” list (
https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-updates-hand-sanitzers-methanol
external icon
). If your product is on this list, stop using the product and dispose of it immediately in appropriate hazardous waste containers; do not flush or pour them down the drain.",[]

Summary

Meningococcal disease, which typically presents as meningitis or meningococcemia, is a life-threatening illness requiring prompt antibiotic treatment for patients and antibiotic prophylaxis for their close contacts. 
Neisseria meningitidis 
isolates in the United States have been largely susceptible to the antibiotics recommended for treatment and prophylaxis. However, 11 meningococcal disease cases reported in the United States during 2019–2020 had isolates containing a 
bla
ROB-1
 β-lactamase gene associated with penicillin resistance, as well as mutations associated with ciprofloxacin resistance. An additional 22 cases reported during 2013–2020 contained a 
bla
ROB-1
 β-lactamasegene but did not have mutations associated with ciprofloxacin resistance.
Background

Meningococcal disease is a sudden-onset, life-threatening illness caused by the bacterium 
Neisseria meningitidis
. Prompt antibiotic treatment can reduce morbidity and mortality among patients and antibiotic prophylaxis can prevent secondary disease in close contacts (
https://redbook.solutions.aap.org/chapter.aspx?sectionid=189640131&bookid=2205
external icon
). Resistance to the antibiotics used for meningococcal treatment and prophylaxis, including penicillin and ciprofloxacin, has been rare in the United States. Recently, however, penicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant 
N. meningitidis 
serogroup Y (NmY) isolates have been detected in the United States.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) made a request for isolate submissions from state health departments and reviewed the existing whole genome sequencing data for those isolates. CDC identified 33 meningococcal disease cases occurring between 2013 and 2020 that were caused by NmY isolates containing a 
bla
ROB-1
 β-lactamase enzyme gene conferring resistance to penicillins. The 33 cases were reported from 12 geographically disparate states. A majority of the cases (22/33, 67%) occurred in Hispanic individuals. Isolates from 11 of these cases, reported during 2019–2020 from nine states, were also resistant to ciprofloxacin. These cases represent a significant increase in penicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant meningococci in the United States.
Recommendations
Healthcare providers
 should perform antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) to determine susceptibility of all meningococcal isolates to penicillin before changing from empirical treatment with cefotaxime or ceftriaxone to penicillin or ampicillin.
In states that have experienced meningococcal disease cases caused by ciprofloxacin-resistant strains within the past 1–2 years, 
clinicians and public health staff
 should consider AST on meningococcal isolates to inform prophylaxis decisions. AST should not delay the initiation of prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin, rifampin, or ceftriaxone.
State and territorial health departments
 should continue submitting all meningococcal isolates to CDC for AST and whole genome sequencing. Health departments also should report any suspected meningococcal treatment or prophylaxis failures.
For cases with isolates determined to be β-lactamase screen-positive or ciprofloxacin-resistant, 
health departments
 should complete a supplemental case report form (available at 
https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/surveillance/index.html
 or on request from 
meningnet@cdc.gov
). Forms can be submitted to CDC via secure email (
meningnet@cdc.gov

Distributed via the CDC Health Alert Network

May 14, 2020, 4:45 PM ET

CDCHAN-00432
Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is providing 1) background information on several cases of a recently reported multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); and 2) a case definition for this syndrome. CDC recommends healthcare providers report any patient who meets the case definition to local, state, and territorial health departments to enhance knowledge of risk factors, pathogenesis, clinical course, and treatment of this syndrome.
Background

On April 26, 2020, clinicians in the United Kingdom (UK) recognized increased reports of previously healthy children presenting with a severe inflammatory syndrome with Kawasaki disease-like features.
1
 The cases occurred in children testing positive for current or recent infection by SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, based on reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or serologic assay, or who had an epidemiologic link to a COVID-19 case. Patients presented with a persistent fever and a constellation of symptoms including hypotension, multiorgan (e.g., cardiac, gastrointestinal, renal, hematologic, dermatologic and neurologic) involvement, and elevated inflammatory markers.
2
 Respiratory symptoms were not present in all cases.
Eight cases, including one death, from the UK were described in a recent publication.
3
 In the limited sample of 8 children, it was reported that 75% of the patients were of Afro-Caribbean descent and 62.5% were male. The report also indicated that all 8 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 through antibody testing, including the patient that died.
3
During March and April, cases of COVID-19 rapidly increased in New York City and New York State. In early May 2020, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene received reports of children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome. From April 16 through May 4, 2020, 15 patients aged 2-15 years were hospitalized, many requiring admission to the intensive care unit. As of May 12, 2020, the New York State Department of Health identified 102 patients (including patients from New York City) with similar presentations, many of whom tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR or serologic assay. New York State and New York City continue to receive additional reports of suspected cases.
Additional reports of children presenting with severe inflammatory syndrome with a laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 or an epidemiological link to a COVID-19 case have been reported by authorities in other countries.
4
It is currently unknown if multisystem inflammatory syndrome is specific to children or if it also occurs in adults.
There is limited information currently available about risk factors, pathogenesis, clinical course, and treatment for MIS-C. CDC is requesting healthcare providers report suspected cases to public health authorities to better characterize this newly recognized condition in the pediatric population.

Recommendations

Healthcare providers who have cared or are caring for patients younger than 21 years of age meeting MIS-C criteria should report suspected cases to their local, state, or territorial health department.
For additional information, please contact CDC’s 24-hour Emergency Operations Center at 770-488-7100. After hour phone numbers for health departments are available at the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists website (

CDCHAN-00431
Summary

Chloroquine phosphate, when used without a prescription and supervision of a healthcare provider, can cause serious health consequences, including death. Clinicians and public health officials should discourage the public from misusing non-pharmaceutical chloroquine phosphate (a chemical used in home aquariums). Clinicians should advise patients and the public that chloroquine, and the related compound hydroxychloroquine, should be used only under the supervision of a healthcare provider as prescribed medications.
Background

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has become aware of two individuals who ingested non-pharmaceutical chloroquine phosphate, a chemical for aquarium use that is commercially available for purchase at stores and through internet websites. One of the individuals died shortly after arrival to the hospital. The second individual was critically ill with severe gastrointestinal symptoms and cardiac conduction abnormalities. Upon recovery, the surviving individual reported to the media that they ingested the product to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2, which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), after seeing information on the medical use of chloroquine on television. The product in their possession was in powder form inside a 2.2-lb. container and labeled “for Ornamental Fish Use Only”.  CDC is also aware of unconfirmed media reports that these commercially available aquarium-use chemicals may be out of stock due to potential increased demand by the public.
At this time, there are no routinely available pharmaceutical products that are FDA-approved for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Pharmaceutical chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat specific medical conditions, such as malaria, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis. Currently, these medications are being studied and evaluated as treatment for COVID-19; however, their efficacy to either prevent or treat this infection are unknown. In overdose situations or when used inappropriately, these medications can lead to severe toxicity, including cardiac rhythm disturbances such as prolonged QT, severe hypokalemia, cardiovascular collapse, seizures, coma, and death. Inappropriate uses include taking commercially available non-pharmaceutical preparations, taking chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate without a prescription, and taking additional doses not recommended by a healthcare provider. Chloroquine phosphate has a narrow therapeutic index—it can be toxic at levels not much higher than those used for treatment—which raises the risk of inadvertent overdose.
Recommendations for Clinicians and Public Health Officials
Educate patients on the serious risks of misusing non-pharmaceutical chloroquine products and other aquarium use chemicals.
Counsel your patients on the importance of taking medications only as prescribed and as directed by healthcare providers.
Contact your local poison center (1-800-222-1222) to report cases and to obtain specific medical management of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine poisoning.
Adverse events related to pharmaceuticals can be reported to the FDA MedWatch program (
https://www.fda.gov/safety/medwatch-fda-safety-information-and-adverse-event-reporting-program
external icon
). Adverse events related to non-pharmaceutical products can be reported by emailing 
FDA-COVID-19-Fraudulent-Products@fda.hhs.gov
 or calling 1-888-InfoFDA (1-888-463-6332).
Recommendations for the Public
Do 
not
 ingest aquarium use products or any other chemicals that contain chloroquine phosphate. These chemicals are not intended for human consumption and can lead to serious health consequences, including death.
Medications like chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate should be taken only when prescribed by and under the supervision of your healthcare provider and always according to the instructions provided.
Seek immediate medical attention if you are experiencing any unexpected symptoms after taking chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine by contacting your healthcare provider or your poison center (1-800-222-1222).",[]

Summary
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends all persons defer any travel on cruise ships, including river cruises, worldwide because of the increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission onboard ships. 
Deferring travel is especially important for older adults and all people with serious chronic medical conditions (such as heart disease, diabetes or lung disease), because of their increased risk for severe disease. This health update provides information to clinicians and state and local health departments about the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation and the risks associated with travel on cruise ships, including river cruises.
Background

Cruise ship passengers, including those who take river cruises, are at increased risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. In the past month, there have been reports of outbreaks of COVID-19 among passengers and crew on cruises. Recent examples include 696 cases and 8 deaths on the 
Diamond Princess
 cruise ship in Japan, 28 cases on the 
Grand Princess
 cruise ship in the United States, and at least 60 cases in 15 states associated with multiple Nile River voyages in Egypt as of March 14, 2020. Illness onset occurred both onboard ships and after passengers returned to the United States. The proximity of passengers and crew on small ships and boats traveling on rivers may result in an even higher number of COVID-19 infections.
Recommendations for Clinicians 

Ask all patients about their planned or recent cruise ship travel, including river cruises.
Pre-travel advice

Advise patients to defer all cruise ship travel, including river cruises, worldwide.
Explain that their return travel to the United States may be impacted, and formal quarantine procedures may be implemented if confirmed cases are identified on board.
Explain that appropriate medical care or medical evacuation may not be available internationally.
Explain that some countries may refuse docking or disembarkation if there are known or suspected cases on board.
For patients who still intend to cruise, advise them to

Stay in their cabin and notify the onboard medical center immediately if they get sick with fever, new or worsening cough, or trouble breathing during their cruise.
Stay home for 14 days after returning from travel, practice social distancing, and monitor their health both during travel and after they return. Social distancing means staying out of crowded places, avoiding group gatherings, and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others, when possible.
Post-travel management

Tell patients to follow CDC’s guidance on steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19 (
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/steps-when-sick.html
) if they develop acute febrile or respiratory illness after travel.
Implement recommended infection prevention and control practices (
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/infection-control/control-recommendations.html
) if you suspect a patient has COVID-19.
Immediately notify the local health department (
https://www.naccho.org/membership/lhd-directory
external icon
) if a patient meets clinical and epidemiologic criteria for a person under investigation (PUI) (
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html
) for COVID-19 and test as appropriate.
Recommendations for State and Local Health Departments

Check 
The Epidemic Information Exchange
 (
Epi-X
) notification system for information on COVID-19 cases on cruise ships and river cruises. In accordance with the Level 3 travel warning (
https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/coronavirus-cruise-ship

Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to closely monitor and respond to the COVID-19 outbreak caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.
This CDC Health Alert Network (HAN) Update highlights guidance and recommendations for evaluating and identifying patients who should be tested for COVID-19 that were shared on March 4, 2020, on the CDC COVID-19 website at 
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html
. It supersedes the guidance and recommendations provided in CDC’s HAN 428 distributed on February 28, 2020.
The outbreak that began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, has now spread throughout China and to 101 other countries and territories, including the United States. As of March 8, 2020, there were more than 105,000 cases reported globally. In addition to sustained transmission in China, there is now community spread in several additional countries. CDC has updated travel guidance to reflect this information (
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html
).
As of March 7, 2020, there were a total of 213 cases within the United States, of which, 49 were among repatriated persons from high-risk settings. Among the other 164 cases that were diagnosed in the United States, 36 were among persons with a history of recent travel in China or other affected areas, and 18 were persons in close contact with another confirmed COVID-19 patient (i.e., person-to-person spread); 110 cases are currently under investigation. During the week of February 23, community spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 was reported in California in two places, Oregon, and Washington. Community spread in Washington resulted in the first reported case of COVID-19 in a healthcare worker, and the first outbreak in a long-term care facility. The first death due to COVID-19 was also reported from Washington; there have now been 11 reported deaths in the U.S. from COVID-19. As of March 7, 2020, COVID-19 cases had been reported by 19 states. CDC will continue to work with state and local health departments, clinicians, and laboratorians to identify and respond to other cases of COVID-19, especially those with an unknown source of infection, to limit further community spread. The most recent update describing COVID-19 in the United States can be found at 
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html
Recognizing persons who are at risk for COVID-19 is a critical component of identifying cases and preventing further transmission. With expanding spread of COVID-19, additional areas of geographic risk are being identified and the criteria for considering testing are being updated to reflect this spread. In addition, with increasing access to testing, the criteria for testing for COVID-19 have been expanded to include more symptomatic persons, even in the absence of travel history to affected areas or known exposure to another case, to quickly detect and respond to community spread of the virus in the United States.
Criteria to Guide Evaluation and Laboratory Testing for COVID-19

Clinicians should work with their local and state health departments to coordinate testing through public health laboratories. In addition, COVID-19 diagnostic testing, authorized by the Food and Drug Administration under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), is becoming available in clinical laboratories. This additional testing capacity will allow clinicians to consider COVID-19 testing for a wider group of symptomatic patients.
Clinicians should use their judgment to determine if a patient has signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and whether the patient should be tested. Most patients with confirmed COVID-19 have developed fever
1
 and/or symptoms of acute respiratory illness (e.g., cough, difficulty breathing). Priorities for testing may include:
Hospitalized patients who have signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 in order to inform decisions related to infection control.
Other symptomatic individuals such as, older adults (age ≥ 65 years) and individuals with chronic medical conditions and/or an immunocompromised state that may put them at higher risk for poor outcomes (e.g., diabetes, heart disease, receiving immunosuppressive medications, chronic lung disease, chronic kidney disease).
Any persons including healthcare personnel
2
, who within 14 days of symptom onset had close contact
3
 with a suspect or laboratory-confirmed
4 
COVID-19 patient, or who have a history of travel from affected geographic areas
5
 (see below) within 14 days of their symptom onset.
There are epidemiologic factors that may also help guide decisions about COVID-19 testing. Documented COVID-19 infections in a jurisdiction and known community transmission may contribute to an epidemiologic risk assessment to inform testing decisions. Clinicians are strongly encouraged to test for other causes of respiratory illness (e.g., influenza).
Mildly ill patients should be encouraged to stay home and contact their healthcare provider by phone for guidance about clinical management. Patients who have severe symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, should seek care immediately. Older patients and individuals who have underlying medical conditions or are immunocompromised should contact their physician early in the course of even mild illness.

Recommendations for Reporting, Laboratory Testing, and Specimen Collection

Clinicians should immediately implement recommended infection prevention and control practices (
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/infection-control/control-recommendations.html
) if a patient is suspected of having COVID-19. They should also notify infection control personnel at their healthcare facility and their state or local health department if it is suspected that a patient may have COVID-19. State health departments that have identified a person suspected of having COVID-19 or a laboratory-confirmed case should complete a PUI and Case Report form through the processes identified on CDC’s Coronavirus Disease 2019 website (

). If specimens are sent to CDC for laboratory testing, state and local health departments can contact CDC’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at 770-488-7100 for assistance with obtaining, storing, and shipping, including after hours, on weekends, and holidays.
Guidance for the identification and management of potentially exposed contacts of a confirmed case of COVID-19 can be found in Interim US Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Persons with Potential Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Exposures: Geographic Risk and Contacts of Laboratory-confirmed Cases (
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/risk-assessment.html
).
Separate guidance for the management of potentially exposed contacts of a COVID-19 case who are healthcare personnel is provided in Interim U.S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) (
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-risk-assesment-hcp.html
).
For initial diagnostic testing for COVID-19, CDC recommends collecting and testing upper respiratory tract specimens (nasopharyngeal AND oropharyngeal swabs). CDC also recommends testing lower respiratory tract specimens, if available. For patients who develop a productive cough, sputum should be collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2. The induction of sputum is not recommended. For patients for whom it is clinically indicated (e.g., those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation), a lower respiratory tract aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage sample should be collected and tested as a lower respiratory tract specimen. Specimens should be collected as soon as possible once a person has been identified for testing, regardless of the time of symptom onset. See Interim Guidelines for Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens from Patients Under Investigation (PUIs) for COVID-19 (

).
1
Fever may be subjective or confirmed
2
For healthcare personnel, testing may be considered if there has been exposure to a person with suspected COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation. Because of their often extensive and close contact with vulnerable patients in healthcare settings, even mild signs and symptoms (e.g., sore throat) of COVID-19 should be evaluated among potentially exposed healthcare personnel. Additional information is available in CDC’s Interim U.S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-risk-assesment-hcp.html
).
3
Close contact is defined as—
a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period; close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a healthcare waiting area or room with a COVID-19 case
– or –
b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g., being coughed on)

If such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) (e.g., gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection), criteria for PUI consideration are met.
Additional information is available in CDC’s updated Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed COVID-19 or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings  (
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/infection-control/control-recommendations.html
).
Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited. Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient). Special consideration should be given to healthcare personnel exposed in healthcare settings as described in CDC’s Interim U.S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with COVID-19 (

Summary
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to closely monitor and respond to the COVID-19 outbreak caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.
This CDC Health Alert Network (HAN) Update provides updated guidance on evaluating and testing persons under investigation (PUIs) for COVID-19. It supersedes guidance provided in CDC’s HAN 427 distributed on February 1, 2020.
The outbreak that began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, has now spread throughout China and to 46 other countries and territories, including the United States. As of February 27, 2020, there were 78,497 reported cases in China and 3,797 cases in locations outside China. In addition to sustained transmission in China, there is evidence of community spread in several additional countries. CDC has updated travel guidance to reflect this information (
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html
).
To date, there has been limited spread of COVID-19 in the United States. As of February 26, 2020, there were a total of 61 cases within the United States, 46 of these were among repatriated persons from high-risk settings. The other 15 cases were diagnosed in the United States; 12 were persons with a history of recent travel in China and 2 were persons in close household contact with a COVID-19 patient (i.e. person-to-person spread). One patient with COVID-19 who had no travel history or links to other known cases was reported on February 26, 2020, in California. The California Department of Public Health, local health departments, clinicians, and CDC are working together to investigate this case and are identifying contacts with whom this individual interacted.
CDC, state and local health departments, other federal agencies, and other partners have been implementing measures to slow and contain transmission of COVID-19 in the United States. These measures include assessing, monitoring, and caring for travelers arriving from areas with substantial COVID-19 transmission and identifying cases and contacts of cases in the United States.
Recognizing persons at risk for COVID-19 is a critical component of identifying cases and preventing further transmission. With expanding spread of COVID-19, additional areas of geographic risk are being identified and PUI criteria are being updated to reflect this spread. To prepare for possible additional person-to-person spread of COVID-19 in the United States, CDC continues to recommend that clinicians and state and local health departments consider COVID-19 in patients with severe respiratory illness even in the absence of travel history to affected areas or known exposure to another case.
Criteria to Guide Evaluation and Testing of Patients Under Investigation (PUI) for COVID-19

Local or state health departments, in consultation with clinicians, should determine whether a patient is a PUI for COVID-19. The CDC clinical criteria for COVID-19 PUIs have been developed based on available information about this novel virus, as well as what is known about Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (
https://www.cdc.gov/sars/clinical/guidance.html
) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/interim-guidance.html#evaluation
). These criteria are subject to change as additional information becomes available.
 
 
These criteria are intended to serve as guidance for evaluation. In consultation with public health departments, patients should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine the need for testing. Testing may be considered for deceased persons who would otherwise meet the PUI criteria.
1
Fever may be subjective or confirmed.
2
For healthcare personnel, testing may be considered if there has been exposure to a person with suspected COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation. Because of their often extensive and close contact with vulnerable patients in healthcare settings, even mild signs and symptoms (e.g., sore throat) of COVID-19 should be evaluated among potentially exposed healthcare personnel. Additional information is available in CDC’s Interim U.S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (

Close contact is defined as—
a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period; close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a healthcare waiting area or room with a COVID-19 case
– or –
b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g., being coughed on)
If such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) (e.g., gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection), criteria for PUI consideration are met.
Additional information is available in CDC’s updated Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed COVID-19 or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings (

Documentation of laboratory-confirmation of COVID-19 may not be possible for travelers or persons caring for COVID-19 patients in other countries.
5
Affected areas are defined as geographic regions where sustained community transmission has been identified.  Relevant affected areas will be defined as a country with at least a CDC Level 2 Travel Health Notice. Current information is available in CDC’s COVID-19 Travel Health Notices (
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers
).
6
Category includes single or clusters of patients with severe acute lower respiratory illness (e.g., pneumonia, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) of unknown etiology in which COVID-19 is being considered.
Recommendations for Reporting, Testing, and Specimen Collection

Clinicians should immediately implement recommended infection prevention and control practices (
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/infection-control/control-recommendations.html
) if a patient is suspected of having COVID-19. They should also notify infection control personnel at their healthcare facility and their state or local health department if a patient is classified as a PUI for COVID-19. State health departments that have identified a PUI or a laboratory-confirmed case should complete a PUI and Case Report form through the processes identified on CDC’s Coronavirus Disease 2019 website (
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/reporting-pui.html
). State and local health departments can contact CDC’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at 770-488-7100 for assistance with obtaining, storing, and shipping appropriate specimens to CDC for testing, including after hours or on weekends or holidays. Currently, diagnostic testing for COVID-19 is being performed at state public health laboratories and CDC.Testing for other respiratory pathogens should not delay specimen testing for COVID-19.
For initial diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2, CDC recommends collecting and testing upper respiratory tract specimens (nasopharyngeal AND oropharyngeal swabs). CDC also recommends testing lower respiratory tract specimens, if available. For patients who develop a productive cough, sputum should be collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2. The induction of sputum is not recommended. For patients for whom it is clinically indicated (e.g., those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation), a lower respiratory tract aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage sample should be collected and tested as a lower respiratory tract specimen. Specimens should be collected as soon as possible once a PUI is identified, regardless of the time of symptom onset.

Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to closely monitor an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that was initially detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in December 2019.
This CDC Health Alert Network (HAN) Update provides a situational update and interim guidance to state and local health departments that supersedes guidance in CDC’s HAN 426 distributed on January 17, 2020. It also adds
guidance for clinicians caring for patients with 2019-nCoV (
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html
),
and for public health officials on the evaluation and testing of patients under investigation (PUIs) for 2019-nCoV (
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html
), and
updated infection prevention and control guidance specific to 2019-nCoV (
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/infection-control.html
).
Early in the outbreak, many of the patients with respiratory illness caused by 2019-nCoV in China had exposure to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-human transmission. More recently, cases have been confirmed with no exposure to animal markets, indicating that person-to-person spread of the virus has occurred. Chinese officials report that sustained person-to-person spread in the community is occurring in China.
The first US case-patient was identified on January 21, 2020, and had recently traveled from Wuhan, China. Since that time, six additional cases have been confirmed in the United States, four among persons who traveled from Wuhan, and one a close contact of a confirmed case. Globally, reported illnesses in people with 2019-nCoV have ranged from mild (no or few signs and symptoms), to severe, including death. These findings are consistent with other coronaviruses, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (
https://www.cdc.gov/sars/
) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/index.html
). Additional information about 2019-nCoV is needed to better understand transmission, disease severity, and risk to the general population. The goal of the ongoing US public health response is to identify and contain this outbreak and prevent sustained spread of 2019-nCoV in the United States.
Recommendations for Screening of Patients for 2019-nCoV in Healthcare Facilities 

Recommendations for screening of patients for possible 2019-nCoV infection are based on (1) current knowledge of the characteristics of clinical illness observed in early cases, and (2) the geographic distribution of current cases. They reflect the current public health goal of rapidly containing and preventing transmission of 2019-nCoV illness.
Patients presenting to healthcare facilities should be assessed for exposures associated with risk of 2019-nCoV infections (e.g., travel to China or close contact with a confirmed case) and for symptoms consistent with 2019-nCoV infection (
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html
). The assessment is intended to allow healthcare providers to make decisions about appropriate infection control and management of patients.  Note that the signs and symptoms of 2019-nCoV overlap with those associated with other viral respiratory tract infections. Given the time of year, common respiratory illnesses, including influenza, should also be considered in patients who are screened. (Figure 1)
Clinicians should ask:
Does the person have fever or symptoms of lower respiratory infection, such as cough or shortness of breath?
AND
Has the patient traveled to mainland China within 14 days of symptom onset?
OR
Has the patient had close contact1 with a person confirmed with 2019-nCoV infection?

Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to closely monitor an outbreak of a 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China that began in December 2019. CDC has established an Incident Management System to coordinate a domestic and international public health response.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people; numerous other coronaviruses circulate among animals, including camels, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can evolve and infect people and then spread between people such as has been seen with Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/index.html
) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (
https://www.cdc.gov/sars/index.html
).
Chinese authorities report most patients in the Wuhan City outbreak have been epidemiologically linked to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting a possible zoonotic origin to the outbreak. Chinese authorities additionally report that they are monitoring several hundred healthcare workers who are caring for outbreak patients; no spread of this virus from patients to healthcare personnel has been reported to date. Chinese authorities are reporting no ongoing spread of this virus in the community, but they cannot rule out that some limited person-to-person spread may be occurring. China has reported that two of the patients have died, including one with pre-existing medical conditions. Chinese health officials publicly posted the genetic sequence of the 2019-nCoV on January 12, 2020. This will facilitate identification of infections with this virus and development of specific diagnostic tests.
Thailand and Japan have confirmed additional cases of 2019-nCoV in travelers from Wuhan, China. It is possible that more cases will be identified in the coming days. This is an ongoing investigation and given previous experience with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, it is possible that person-person spread may occur. There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with 2019-nCoV as the investigations in China, Thailand, and Japan continue. Additional information about this novel virus is needed to better inform population risk.
This HAN Update provides a situational update and guidance to state and local health departments and healthcare providers that supersedes guidance in CDC’s HAN Advisory 424 distributed on January 8, 2020. This HAN Update adds guidance for evaluation of patients under investigation (PUI) for 2019-nCoV, prevention and infection control guidance, including the addition of an eye protection recommendation, and additional information on specimen collection.
Background

An outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan City was initially reported to WHO on December 31, 2019. Chinese health authorities have confirmed more than 40 infections with a novel coronavirus as the cause of the outbreak. Reportedly, most patients had epidemiological links to a large seafood and animal market. The market was closed on January 1, 2020. Currently, Chinese health authorities report no community spread of this virus, and no transmission among healthcare personnel caring for outbreak patients. No additional cases of infection with 2019-nCoV have been identified in China since January 3, 2020.
On January 13, 2020 public health officials in Thailand confirmed detection of a human infection with 2019-nCoV in a traveler from Wuhan, China. This was the first confirmed case of 2019-nCoV documented outside China. On January 17, 2020 a second case was confirmed in Thailand, also in a returned traveler from Wuhan City. On January 15, 2020 health officials in Japan confirmed 2019-nCoV infection in a returned traveler from Wuhan City. These persons had onset dates after January 3, 2020. These cases did not report visiting the large seafood and animal market to which many cases in China have been linked.
On January 11, 2020, CDC updated the level 1 travel health notice (“practice usual precautions”) for Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China with additional information (originally issued on January 6, 2020): 
https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/watch/novel-coronavirus-china
Recommendations for Healthcare Providers

Limited information is available to characterize the spectrum of clinical illness associated with 2019-nCoV. No vaccine or specific treatment for 2019-nCoV infection is available; care is supportive.
The CDC clinical criteria for a 2019-nCoV patient under investigation (PUI) have been developed based on what is known about MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV and are subject to change as additional information becomes available.
Healthcare providers should obtain a detailed travel history for patients being evaluated with fever and acute respiratory illness. CDC guidance for evaluating and reporting a PUI for MERS-CoV remains unchanged.
Criteria to Guide Evaluation of Patients Under Investigation (PUI) for 2019-nCoV

Patients in the United States who meet the following criteria should be evaluated as a PUI in association with the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan City, China.
The above criteria are also available at 
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/clinical-criteria.html
. The criteria are intended to serve as guidance for evaluation. Patients should be evaluated and discussed with public health departments on a case-by-case basis if their clinical presentation or exposure history is equivocal (e.g., uncertain travel or exposure).
Recommendations for Reporting, Testing, and Specimen Collection

Healthcare providers should 
immediately
 notify both infection control personnel at their healthcare facility and their local or state health department in the event of a PUI for 2019-nCoV. State health departments that have identified a PUI should immediately contact CDC’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at 770-488-7100 and complete a 2019-nCoV PUI case investigation form available at 
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/pui-form.pdf
pdf icon
. CDC’s EOC will assist local/state health departments to collect, store, and ship specimens appropriately to CDC, including during afterhours or on weekends/holidays. At this time, diagnostic testing for 2019-nCoV can be conducted only at CDC. Testing for other respiratory pathogens should not delay specimen shipping to CDC. If a PUI tests positive for another respiratory pathogen, after clinical evaluation and consultation with public health authorities, they may no longer be considered a PUI. This may evolve as more information becomes available on possible 2019 nCoV co-infections.
For biosafety reasons, it is not recommended to perform virus isolation in cell culture or initial characterization of viral agents recovered in cultures of specimens from a PUI for 2019-nCoV.
 To increase the likelihood of detecting 2019-nCoV infection, CDC recommends collecting and testing multiple clinical specimens from different sites, including all three specimen types—lower respiratory, upper respiratory, and serum specimens. Additional specimen types (e.g., stool, urine) may be collected and stored. Specimens should be collected as soon as possible once a PUI is identified regardless of time of symptom onset. Additional guidance for collection, handling, and testing of clinical specimens is available at 
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/
Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients Under Investigation for 2019-nCoV

Although the transmission dynamics have yet to be determined, CDC currently recommends a cautious approach to patients under investigation for 2019-nCoV (
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/clinical-criteria.html
). Such patients should be asked to wear a surgical mask as soon as they are identified and be evaluated in a private room with the door closed, ideally an airborne infection isolation room if available. Healthcare personnel entering the room should use standard precautions, contact precautions, airborne precautions, and use eye protection (e.g., goggles or a face shield). Immediately notify your healthcare facility’s infection control personnel and local health department.

Notes
1
Fever may not be present in some patients, such as those who are very young, elderly, immunosuppressed, or taking certain fever-lowering medications. Clinical judgment should be used to guide testing of patients in such situations.
2
Close contact with a person who is under investigation for 2019-nCOV.

Close contact is defined as—
See CDC’s 
Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus
 (
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/infection-control.html
).
Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited. Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with novel coronavirus (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient). Special consideration should be given to those exposed in healthcare settings.","['https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/clinical-criteria.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/clinical-criteria.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/infection-control.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/infection-control.html']"

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reminds clinicians that influenza B viruses can cause severe illness in people of all ages, including children. CDC continues to recommend influenza vaccination and prompt antiviral treatment of high-risk outpatients and hospitalized patients with suspected influenza.
Summary

This health advisory notifies clinicians that influenza activity remains high in the United States. Ongoing elevated activity is due to influenza B/Victoria viruses, increasing circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, and low levels of influenza B/Yamagata and influenza A(H3N2) viruses. CDC’s influenza forecasts suggest that national influenza activity will remain elevated for several more weeks. Because influenza activity is elevated and both influenza A and B virus infections can cause severe disease and death, this health advisory also serves as a reminder that early treatment with antiviral medications improves outcomes in patients with influenza. Early treatment with antiviral medications is recommended for hospitalized patients and high-risk outpatients, including children younger than two years. Clinicians should continue efforts to vaccinate patients for as long as influenza viruses are circulating, and promptly start antiviral treatment of severely ill and high-risk patients with suspected influenza without waiting for laboratory confirmation.
Background

In the United States, influenza activity remains elevated and widespread, and the season is likely to last several more weeks (see CDC FluView report for details: 
https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm
).  Since early this season, influenza B viruses, specifically B/Victoria viruses, have been reported more frequently than other influenza viruses, followed by A(H1N1)pdm09. Different viruses have predominated in different parts of the country and among different age groups. Influenza B viruses can cause severe illness in people of all ages, including children.
1
 In past seasons, the proportion of influenza-related pediatric deaths associated with influenza B viruses has generally been higher than the proportion of influenza B among circulating viruses,
2,3
 and pediatric mortality from influenza B–associated hospitalizations has been reported to be higher than with influenza A–associated hospitalizations.
4
 So far this season, influenza B virus infections account for about half of hospitalizations reported through CDC’s laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalization surveillance network and the majority of reported influenza-associated pediatric deaths (
https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm
). Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses are increasing and becoming predominant in some regions. These viruses can also cause severe illness, particularly in adults not originally exposed to currently circulating A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses.
5
 Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses currently comprise the majority of the other half of hospitalizations reported through CDC’s laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalization surveillance network.
CDC continues to recommend everyone six months of age and older get vaccinated for influenza. CDC also recommends antiviral medications for the treatment of influenza, because antiviral treatment has shown clinical and public health benefit in reducing illness and lessening severe outcomes of influenza based on evidence from randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials, and observational studies during past influenza seasons and during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.
6-13
 Influenza antiviral medications are most effective in treating influenza and reducing complications when treatment is started early (within 48 hours of illness onset). Some studies suggest clinical benefit among hospitalized patients and young children with febrile illness even when treatment was started three to five days after illness onset.
14-20 
Recommendations for Clinicians
All People Six Months and Older Who Have Not Yet Received an Influenza Vaccine this Season Should Be Vaccinated Against Influenza
All available vaccine formulations this season contain A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, and B/Victoria virus strains.
21
 The 2019-2020 U.S. quadrivalent influenza vaccines contain these and an additional influenza B/Yamagata virus. CDC does not recommend one influenza vaccine formulation over another.
 All Hospitalized, Severely Ill, and High-risk Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Influenza, Regardless of Influenza Vaccination Status, Should Be Treated with Antivirals
 As Soon As Possible After Onset of Illness
Antiviral treatment is recommended as early as possible for any patient with suspected or confirmed influenza who—

Is hospitalized.
Has severe, complicated, or progressive illness. This may include outpatients with severe or prolonged progressive symptoms or patients who develop complications such as pneumonia but who are not hospitalized.
Is at high risk for influenza complications but not hospitalized. This includes—

Children younger than two years. Although children younger than five years are considered at higher risk for complications from influenza, the highest risk is for those younger than two years.
Adults 65 years and older.
People with chronic pulmonary (including asthma), cardiovascular (except hypertension alone), renal, hepatic, hematological (including sickle cell disease), and metabolic (including diabetes mellitus) disorders.
People with neurologic and neurodevelopment conditions, including disorders of the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerve, and muscle, such as cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, stroke, intellectual disability, moderate to severe developmental delay, muscular dystrophy, or spinal cord injury.
People with immunosuppression, including that caused by medications or by HIV infection.
Women who are pregnant or postpartum (within two weeks after delivery).
People younger than 19 years who are receiving long-term aspirin therapy.
American Indians and Alaska Natives.
People with extreme obesity (i.e., body mass index is equal to or greater than 40).
Residents of nursing homes and other chronic care facilities.
Antiviral Treatment in Non-High-Risk Patients with Uncomplicated Influenza 
Antiviral treatment can benefit other individuals with influenza. While current guidance focuses on antiviral treatment of those with severe illness or at high risk of complications, antiviral treatment may be prescribed for any previously healthy (non-high risk) outpatient with suspected or confirmed influenza who presents within two days after illness onset. Multiple randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses of RCTs have demonstrated efficacy of early initiation of treatment (started within 48 hours of illness onset) with neuraminidase inhibitors in reducing duration of fever and illness symptoms by about a day compared with placebo in otherwise healthy children and adults with uncomplicated influenza.
6,9
 Clinical judgment—considering the patient’s disease severity and progression, age, likelihood of influenza, and time since onset of symptoms is important when making antiviral treatment decisions for outpatients who are not at increased risk for influenza complications.
Choice of Antiviral Medication
Four influenza antiviral medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are recommended for use in the United States during the 2019-2020 influenza season.

Three drugs are chemically related antiviral medications known as neuraminidase inhibitors: oral 
oseltamivir
 
phosphate
 (available as a generic version or under the trade name Tamiflu®), inhaled 
zanamivir
 (trade name Relenza®), and intravenous 
peramivir
 (trade name Rapivab®). These medications block the viral neuraminidase enzyme and have activity against both influenza A and B viruses.
The fourth drug is oral 
baloxavir marboxil
 (trade name Xofluza®), which is active against both influenza A and B viruses but has a different mechanism of action. Baloxavir is a cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor that interferes with viral RNA transcription and blocks virus replication. In October 2019, FDA approved an indication for baloxavir treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza within two days of illness onset in people 12 years and older at high risk of developing influenza-related complications, based upon the findings of a clinical trial.
22
 In the clinical trial of early initiation of antiviral treatment for uncomplicated influenza in high-risk adolescents and adults, baloxavir was superior to placebo and had similar overall efficacy to oseltamivir in the time to alleviation of symptoms. There are no available data for baloxavir treatment of influenza in pregnant women, immunocompromised people, those with severe disease, or hospitalized patients.
Recommended ages for treatment and prevention with antiviral medications are summarized in the table below. Dosing and more detailed treatment considerations can be found in the Influenza Antiviral Medications: Summary for Clinicians (
https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/antivirals/summary-clinicians.htm
 
 
Timing of Treatment and Implications for Patient Evaluation, Treatment, and Testing
Clinical benefit is greatest when antiviral treatment is administered as close to illness onset as possible. Therefore, 
antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible and
 
should not wait for laboratory confirmation of influenza
.  Ideally, treatment should be initiated within 48 hours of onset of symptoms. However, antiviral treatment initiated later than 48 hours after illness onset can still be beneficial for some patients.

A history of current season influenza vaccination does not exclude a diagnosis of influenza in an ill child or adult. High-risk patients should be advised to call their healthcare provider promptly if they have symptoms of influenza.
Specimens from all hospitalized patients with suspected influenza should be tested with molecular assays with high sensitivity and specificity since influenza testing can help inform clinical management and prompt implementation of infection prevention and control measures for influenza. Molecular assays (including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) should be used for influenza testing of hospitalized patients. Treatment should be empiric and should start as soon as possible.

Treatment should not wait for laboratory confirmation.

Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is closely monitoring a reported cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology (PUE) with possible epidemiologic links to a large wholesale fish and live animal market in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. An outbreak investigation by local officials is ongoing in China; the World Health Organization (WHO) is the lead international public health agency. Currently, there are no known U.S. cases nor have cases been reported in countries other than China. CDC has established an Incident Management Structure to optimize domestic and international coordination if additional public health actions are required.
This HAN Advisory informs state and local health departments and health care providers about this outbreak and requests that health care providers ask patients with severe respiratory disease about travel history to Wuhan City. Wuhan City is a major transportation hub about 700 miles south of Beijing with a population of more than 11 million people.
Background

According to a report from the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, as of January 5, 2020, the national authorities in China have reported 59 patients with PUE to WHO. The patients had symptom onset dates from December 12 through December 29, 2019. Patients involved in the cluster reportedly have had fever, dyspnea, and bilateral lung infiltrates on chest radiograph. Of the 59 cases, seven are critically ill, and the remaining patients are in stable condition. No deaths have been reported and no health care providers have been reported to be ill. The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission has not reported human-to-human transmission.
Reports indicate that some of the patients were vendors at the Wuhan South China Seafood City (South China Seafood Wholesale Market) where, in addition to seafood, chickens, bats, marmots, and other wild animals are sold, suggesting a possible zoonotic origin to the outbreak. The market has been closed for cleaning and disinfection. Local authorities have reported negative laboratory test results for seasonal influenza, avian influenza, adenovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) among patients associated with this cluster. Additional laboratory testing is ongoing to determine the source of the outbreak. Health authorities are monitoring more than 150 contacts of patients for illness.
CDC has issued a level 1 travel notice (“practice usual precautions”) for this destination. (
https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/watch/pneumonia-china
). On January 5, 2020, WHO posted an update on this situation, including an early risk assessment, which is available at: 
https://www.who.int/csr/don/05-january-2020-pneumonia-of-unkown-cause-china/en/

Recommendations for Health Care Providers
Providers should consider pneumonia related to the cluster for patients with severe respiratory symptoms who traveled to Wuhan since December 1, 2019 and had onset of illness within two weeks of returning, 
and
 who do not have another known diagnosis that would explain their illness. Providers should notify infection control personnel and local and state health departments immediately if any patients meet these criteria. State health departments should notify CDC after identifying a case under investigation by calling CDC’s Emergency Operations Center at (770) 488-7100.
Multiple respiratory tract specimens should be collected from persons with infections suspected to be associated with this cluster, including nasopharyngeal, nasal, and throat swabs. Patients with severe respiratory disease also should have lower respiratory tract specimens collected, if possible. Consider saving urine, stool, serum, and respiratory pathology specimens if available.
Although the etiology and transmissibility have yet to be determined, and to date, no human-to-human transmission has been reported and no health care providers have been reported ill, CDC currently recommends a cautious approach to symptomatic patients with a history of travel to Wuhan City. Such patients should be asked to wear a surgical mask as soon as they are identified and be evaluated in a private room with the door closed. Personnel entering the room to evaluate the patient should use contact precautions and wear an N95 disposable facepiece respirator. For patients admitted for inpatient care, contact and airborne isolation precautions, in addition to standard precautions, are recommended until further information becomes available.

This guidance will be updated as more information becomes available.",[]
